Tagged plays appear as markers on the video timeline, making it easy to jump to specific plays later.

## 5. Tips for Success

1. **Tag plays right after the game.** The details are fresh in your mind, and you'll save time later when game planning.

2. **Use consistent naming.** Name your games and videos consistently (e.g., "Week 1 vs Lincoln") so they're easy to find.

3. **Start simple.** Begin by tagging just down, distance, and result. You can add more detail as you get comfortable with the app.

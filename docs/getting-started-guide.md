## Tips for Success

### Getting Started

1. **Set up your roster first** - Add all your players with jersey numbers and positions. This makes tagging film much faster.

2. **Start with your base plays** - You don't need to add your entire playbook at once. Start with your 10-15 core plays.

3. **Upload film after each game** - The sooner you upload, the sooner you can start analysis.

### Tagging Plays

4. **Tag plays right after the game** - The details are fresh in your mind, and you'll save time later when game planning.

5. **Use consistent naming** - Name your games consistently (e.g., "Week 1 vs. Lincoln") so they're easy to find.

6. **Start simple** - Begin by tagging just down, distance, and result. Add more detail as you get comfortable.

### Using Analytics

7. **Review analytics weekly** - Check your success rate by formation and down to identify what's working.

8. **Look for trends** - Use analytics to spot patterns—maybe you're more effective running left, or your passing game struggles on 3rd down.

9. **Share with your staff** - Invite assistant coaches so everyone can access the same data.

### Game Planning

10. **Build game plans from your playbook** - Link plays directly from your playbook to your game plan.

11. **Use the opponent's tendencies** - If you've tagged opponent film, use analytics to spot their patterns.

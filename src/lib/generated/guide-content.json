Click **Save Play** to record the tag\n\n## Understanding Tagging Levels\n\nYouth Coach Hub offers different levels of detail based on your needs:\n\n### Quick\n\n*Track the game, remember the season* (~15-20 sec per play)\n\nCapture game essentials without the time investment:\n\n- Quarter and time\n- Ball carrier\n- Yards gained\n- Result (touchdown, first down, etc.)\n- Turnovers and big plays\n\n### Standard\n\n*Understand what's working, prepare for next week* (~30-45 sec per play)\n\nAdd play-level context to see which plays succeed:\n\n- All Quick fields\n- Down and distance\n- Formation and play type\n- QB and target (for passes)\n- Drive tracking\n- Situational tendencies\n\n### Comprehensive\n\n*Evaluate and develop every player* (~2-3 min per play)\n\nFull player-level tracking for detailed analysis:\n\n- All Standard fields\n- Position-by-position grades for all offensive players\n- Position-by-position grades for all defensive players\n- Situational tags (motion, blitz, etc.)\n- Coverage information\n\n## Play Details\n\n### Context Fields\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Down | 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th down |\n| Distance | Yards needed for first down |\n| Yard Line | Field position (1-99) |\n| Hash | Left, middle, or right hash |\n\n### Result Fields\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Yards Gained | Net yards on the play |\n| Result | Outcome (complete, incomplete, run, etc.) |\n| First Down | Did the play result in a first down? |\n| Turnover | Was there a fumble or interception? |\n\n## Auto-Population\n\nYouth Coach Hub automatically calculates the next play's context based on the previous play:\n\n- **Down** advances automatically\n- **Distance** adjusts based on yards gained and penalties\n- **Yard Line** updates based on the result\n\nAuto-populated fields are highlighted in blue. You can always override these values manually.\n\n> **Tip:** If a penalty was declined, check the \"Penalty Declined\" box so it doesn't affect the next play's calculations.\n\n## Tagging Tips\n\n### Be Consistent\n\nUse the same criteria for success/failure across all plays. This ensures your analytics are meaningful.\n\n### Tag Both Teams\n\nTag both your offensive plays and opponent's plays. This gives you:\n\n- Defensive analytics for your team\n- Scouting data on opponents\n\n### Use Drives\n\nGroup plays into drives to see:\n\n- Points per drive\n- Drive efficiency\n- Red zone performance\n\n### Review Your Tags\n\nPeriodically review tagged plays to ensure accuracy. Incorrect tags lead to incorrect analytics.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nSpeed up tagging with these shortcuts:\n\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| `Space` | Play/Pause video |\n| `[` | Mark play start |\n| `]` | Mark play end |\n| `Enter` | Save play |\n| `Left Arrow` | Rewind 5 seconds |\n| `Right Arrow` | Forward 5 seconds |\n",

Game Day Ready is about having all your preparation organized and accessible so you can focus on coaching, not scrambling for information.\n\n## Pre-Game Checklist\n\n### Know Your Team\n\nBefore the game, review your own tendencies:\n\n- **What's working** - Your highest success rate plays and formations\n- **Situational strengths** - Where you execute best\n- **Player matchups** - Who's performing well, who needs support\n- **Key plays** - Your go-to calls for critical situations\n\n### Know Your Opponent\n\nHave these answers ready:\n\n- **Their base defense/offense** - What will you see most often?\n- **Tendency triggers** - What tips their hand? (Formation, personnel, alignment)\n- **Blitz/pressure patterns** - When do they attack?\n- **Exploitable weaknesses** - Where can you attack?\n\n### Have Your Adjustments Ready\n\nPre-plan your responses:\n\n| If They Show... | We Will... |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| Heavy man coverage | Run quick game, use motion |\n| Soft zone | Attack intermediate zones |\n| Overloaded box | Spread them out, use screens |\n| Pressure | Hot routes, quick passes |\n\n## Building Your Game Day Call Sheet\n\nThe call sheet is your organized menu of plays selected specifically for this game. Youth Coach Hub helps you build it based on data.\n\n### Selecting Plays by Situation\n\nFrom your playbook, select plays for each situation based on:\n\n- **Success rate** from your analytics\n- **Matchup** against opponent tendencies\n- **Practice performance** during the week\n\n### Call Sheet Structure\n\nOrganize your plays by situation:\n\n| Situation | Plays Selected | Why |\n|-----------|---------------|-----|\n| **1st & 10** | Inside Zone, Outside Zone, PA Boot, Curl-Flat | High success rate on early downs |\n| **2nd & Medium** | Counter, Slant-Flat, Draw, Screen | Balanced options |\n| **2nd & Long** | Deep Cross, 4 Verts, Swing Pass | Need chunk plays |\n| **3rd & Short** | Power, QB Sneak, Slant | Reliable converters |\n| **3rd & Medium** | Mesh, Levels, Stick | 65%+ success rate |\n| **3rd & Long** | Flood, 4 Verts, Screen | Best shot plays |\n| **Red Zone** | Sprint Out, Fade, Power, PA Rollout | Scoring plays |\n| **Goal Line** | QB Sneak, Dive, Bootleg, Fade | Short yardage |\n| **2-Minute** | Quick outs, Spike, Sideline routes | Clock management |\n\n### Generating the Call Sheet\n\n1. Go to **Game Week > Call Sheet Builder**\n2. Select the upcoming game\n3. For each situation, choose plays from your playbook\n4. The system shows success rates to inform your choices\n5. Export or print your organized call sheet\n\n## QB Wristband Printout\n\nThe wristband is the QB's quick reference on the field - a condensed version of the call sheet that fits on their arm.\n\n### What Goes on the Wristband\n\nKeep it simple and scannable:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────┐\n│     GAME DAY WRISTBAND      │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ 1ST DOWN                    │\n│ 11-IZ  12-OZ  13-PA  14-CF  │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ 2ND MED                     │\n│ 21-CTR 22-SL  23-DRW 24-SCR │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ 3RD SHORT                   │\n│ 31-PWR 32-SNK 33-SLT        │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ 3RD MEDIUM                  │\n│ 41-MSH 42-LVL 43-STK        │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ RED ZONE                    │\n│ 51-SPO 52-FD  53-PWR 54-PA  │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ GOAL LINE                   │\n│ 61-SNK 62-DIV 63-BT  64-FD  │\n└─────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Creating the Wristband\n\n1. Go to **Game Week > Wristband Builder**\n2. Your call sheet plays auto-populate\n3. Assign short codes (2-3 characters) to each play\n4. Organize by situation category\n5. Print to wristband-sized format\n\n### Wristband Best Practices\n\n- **Use consistent codes** - Same abbreviations every game\n- **Limit choices** - 3-5 plays per situation max\n- **Number system** - First digit = situation, second = play option\n- **Practice with it** - QB should use wristband in practice\n\n## Coach's Sideline Sheet\n\nA larger format for the play-caller with more detail:\n\n```\nOPPONENT TENDENCIES\n- 1st Down: 60% run, favor inside zone\n- 3rd & Medium: 70% Cover 3, 30% blitz\n- Red Zone: Heavy sets, power run\n\nCALL SHEET BY SITUATION\n[Full play names with formation and motion calls]\n\nADJUSTMENTS\n- vs Cover 3: Attack seams, use out routes\n- vs Man: Motion to create picks, quick game\n- vs Pressure: Slide protection, hot routes\n\nKEY REMINDERS\n- Their #24 is their best cover corner\n- They substitute on 3rd down - watch for nickel\n- QB likes to scramble right under pressure\n```\n\n### Printing Options\n\nExport your preparation materials:\n\n- **Full Call Sheet** - Letter size, detailed\n- **QB Wristband** - Wristband card format\n- **Sideline Reference** - Laminated coaching sheet\n- **Adjustment Card** - Quick if/then reference\n\n## In-Game Adjustments\n\n### First Quarter Observations\n\nUse the first quarter to validate your preparation:\n\n- Are they doing what you expected?\n- What's different from the film?\n- What adjustments do you need to make?\n\n### Halftime Analysis\n\nAt halftime, quickly review:\n\n- What's working? Do more of it.\n- What's not working? Adjust or abandon.\n- What are they doing differently? Counter it.\n\n### Second Half Execution\n\nApply your adjustments:\n\n- Call plays that attack what you're seeing\n- Avoid plays that aren't working\n- Trust your preparation\n\n## Post-Game: Complete the Cycle\n\nAfter the game, the cycle continues:\n\n### Immediate Notes\n\nWhile it's fresh, note:\n\n- What adjustments worked?\n- What didn't go as planned?\n- What do you need to practice?\n\n### Film Review Priorities\n\nWhen you review film:\n\n- Tag the game for your analytics\n- Identify coaching points for players\n- Note opponent tendencies for future reference\n\n### Update Your Data\n\nYour post-game film tagging:\n\n- Updates your team's analytics\n- Adds to your play-by-play history\n- Improves future game preparation\n\n## The Confidence of Preparation\n\nWhen you walk onto the field:\n\n- You've studied your opponent thoroughly\n- You know your team's strengths and weaknesses\n- You have data-backed play calls for every situation\n- You've practiced against realistic looks\n- You have adjustments ready for what they'll show\n\nThis is the competitive advantage of preparation. You're not guessing - you're making informed decisions based on evidence.\n\n> **The Final Word:** Game Day Ready isn't about having all the answers.

    "content": "\n## Where Data Becomes Coaching\n\nGame Week Preparation is where everything comes together. All the film you've tagged, all the plays you've built, and all the analytics you've generated culminate here. This is where data transforms into the insights and preparation that help you show up ready to coach well when it matters most.\n\n## The Preparation Workflow\n\nYouth Coach Hub guides you through a structured preparation process:\n\n### 1. Review Your Data\n\nBefore you can prepare, you need to understand what you're working with:\n\n- **Your team's tendencies** - What plays work best in which situations?\n- **Success rates by formation** - Where are you most effective?\n- **Down and distance patterns** - What do you typically call on 3rd and long?\n- **Red zone performance** - How do you score when it matters?\n\n### 2. Scout the Opponent\n\nIf you've tagged opponent film from previous games:\n\n- **Defensive tendencies** - What coverage do they run most often?\n- **Blitz patterns** - When and how do they bring pressure?\n- **Personnel groupings** - How do they substitute?\n- **Weaknesses to exploit** - Where can your offense attack?\n\n### 3. Build Your Game Plan\n\nArmed with data, you can make informed decisions:\n\n- Select plays that match up well against their defense\n- Identify key adjustments based on what you expect to see\n- Prepare answers for their most common looks\n- Focus practice time on situational execution\n\n### 4. Prepare Your Team\n\nTurn your game plan into practice:\n\n- Install scripts based on expected opponent tendencies\n- Walk through adjustments your players need to recognize\n- Build confidence with data-backed play calling\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nMost coaches rely on gut feeling and memory. Youth Coach Hub gives you:\n\n| Traditional Approach | With Youth Coach Hub |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| \"I think they run Cover 3\" | \"They run Cover 3 on 68% of passing downs\" |\n| \"We should run more\" | \"Our run game averages 5.2 YPC from 12 personnel\" |\n| \"They blitz a lot\" | \"They blitz 45% on 3rd and 6+\" |\n| \"We struggle in the red zone\" | \"Red zone TD% is 42% - passing is 55%, rushing is 31%\" |\n\n## The Competitive Edge\n\nWhen you walk onto the field on game day:\n\n- You know exactly what your team does well\n- You understand your opponent's patterns\n- You have data-backed answers for situations\n- Your players have practiced against realistic looks\n\nThis isn't about replacing coaching instincts - it's about informing them with evidence so you can make better decisions under pressure.\n\n> **The Bottom Line:** Game Week Preparation is where Youth Coach Hub delivers its greatest value. All the tagging, all the analytics - they exist to help you coach better when the game is on the line.\n",

Youth Coach Hub helps you use it wisely by identifying exactly what your team needs to work on based on real performance data.\n\n## Identifying Practice Priorities\n\n### What to Work On\n\nYour analytics reveal areas that need attention:\n\n**Offensive Priorities:**\n- Plays with low success rates that you want to keep calling\n- Situations where you struggle (3rd down, red zone, goal line)\n- Formations where your execution is inconsistent\n\n**Defensive Priorities:**\n- Coverages that opponents are attacking successfully\n- Situations where you're giving up big plays\n- Alignment or assignment issues showing up in film\n\n### What's Working\n\nDon't forget to reinforce success:\n\n- High-success plays that deserve more reps\n- Formations where your team executes consistently\n- Situations where you're performing well\n\n## Building Practice Scripts\n\n### Offensive Scripts\n\nCreate practice scripts based on:\n\n1. **Tendency Data** - What does the opponent usually show?\n2. **Your Best Plays** - What should you call against those looks?\n3. **Situation Focus** - What game situations need work?\n\n**Example Script Building:**\n\n| Situation | Opponent Tendency | Your Play Call |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|\n| 1st & 10 | Base 4-3, Cover 2 | Inside Zone, Play Action |\n| 3rd & 5-7 | Nickel, Cover 3 | Slant-Flat, Mesh |\n| Red Zone | Goal Line, Man | Sprint Out, Fade |\n\n### Defensive Scripts\n\nFor your scout team offense:\n\n1. Review opponent's most common plays\n2. Build a card system based on their tendencies\n3. Have scout team run realistic looks\n\n## Practice Period Structure\n\n### Individual Periods\n\nFocus on technique work informed by film review:\n\n- Position-specific corrections from game film\n- Skill development for weaknesses identified in analytics\n- Repetition of fundamentals that lead to success\n\n### Team Periods\n\nStructure team reps around game-like situations:\n\n**Situational Practice Ideas:**\n\n| Period | Focus | Data Source |\n|--------|-------|-------------|\n| 3rd Down | Converting/Stopping | 3rd down success rates |\n| Red Zone | Scoring/Defending | Red zone efficiency |\n| 2-Minute | Clock management | Drive analytics |\n| Goal Line | Short yardage | Goal-to-go conversion |\n\n### Scrimmage Periods\n\nCreate game-realistic scenarios:\n\n- Start at specific down/distance/field position\n- Use opponent tendencies for defensive looks\n- Track success just like a game\n\n## Tracking Practice to Game Correlation\n\nOver time, you can see if practice is translating:\n\n- Are plays you rep heavily performing better?\n- Are situations you focus on improving?\n- Is there carryover from practice to games?\n\n## Weekly Practice Template\n\n**Monday: Install & Corrections**\n- Review film from previous game\n- Identify areas for improvement\n- Begin installing game plan\n\n**Tuesday: Situational Focus**\n- Practice identified priorities\n- Run opponent scout looks\n- Work on corrections from Monday\n\n**Wednesday: Team Execution**\n- Full team periods with game situations\n- Polish game plan plays\n- Simulate opponent tendencies\n\n**Thursday: Fine-Tuning**\n- Light practice\n- Review key adjustments\n- Walk through game plan\n\n**Friday: Mental Prep**\n- Walk through only\n- Review scouting report\n- Visualize game situations\n\n> **Remember:** The goal isn't to practice everything - it's to practice the right things.

Every play you've tagged about your opponent contributes to a clearer picture of what you'll face on game day.\n\n## Generating a Scouting Report\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo generate a meaningful scouting report, you need:\n\n- At least one game with opponent plays tagged\n- Basic tagging data (formation, play type, result)\n- Ideally 20+ plays for statistical significance\n\n### Creating the Report\n\n1. Navigate to **Game Week** from your team dashboard\n2. Select **Scouting Reports**\n3. Choose the opponent you're preparing for\n4. Select which games to include in the analysis\n5. Click **Generate Report**\n\n## What the Report Shows\n\n### Defensive Tendencies\n\nIf you're scouting their defense:\n\n| Metric | What It Tells You |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Base Formation % | What defense do they line up in most? |\n| Coverage Distribution | Man vs Zone breakdown |\n| Blitz Rate by Down | When do they bring pressure? |\n| Tendencies by Hash | Do they favor certain looks by field position? |\n\n### Offensive Tendencies\n\nIf you're scouting their offense:\n\n| Metric | What It Tells You |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Run/Pass Ratio | Are they run-heavy or pass-happy? |\n| Personnel Groupings | What formations do they favor? |\n| Play Type by Down | What do they call on 1st down vs 3rd? |\n| Key Players | Who gets the ball most often? |\n\n### Situational Analysis\n\nThe report breaks down tendencies by situation:\n\n- **Early Downs** (1st & 2nd) - What's their approach when ahead of schedule?\n- **Third Down** - How do they convert? What do they call?\n- **Red Zone** - How do they try to score?\n- **Goal Line** - What's their go-to play?\n- **Two-Minute** - How do they operate under time pressure?\n\n## Using the Data\n\n### Identify Exploitable Patterns\n\nLook for:\n\n- **Predictable tendencies** - Do they always run on 1st down?\n- **Coverage tells** - Does their safety alignment give away the coverage?\n- **Personnel-based patterns** - Do certain players only come in for certain plays?\n\n### Prepare Counter-Strategies\n\nFor each tendency you identify:\n\n1. Note the pattern\n2. Select plays from your playbook that attack it\n3. Practice recognition and execution\n\n### Create Game Day Notes\n\nExport key insights to a condensed format you can reference during the game:\n\n- Top 5 things to remember\n- Adjustments by situation\n- Key players to watch\n\n## Building Better Reports Over Time\n\nThe more opponent film you tag, the better your scouting reports become:\n\n- **Multiple games** reveal consistent tendencies vs. one-game anomalies\n- **Detailed tagging** (Standard or Comprehensive) provides richer analysis\n- **Personnel tracking** shows substitution patterns\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Tag opponent film immediately after games while it's fresh. The data you collect throughout the season makes your playoff scouting reports invaluable.\n",

We actively listen to coaches and use your input to prioritize new features, improvements, and fixes.\n\n## Ways to Provide Feedback\n\n### In-App Feedback Button\n\nThe easiest way to send feedback:\n\n1. Look for the **Feedback** button in the navigation\n2. Click to open the feedback form\n3. Select a feedback type\n4. Write your message\n5. Submit\n\n### Feedback Types\n\nWhen submitting feedback, categorize it:\n\n| Type | Use For |\n|------|---------|\n| **Feature Request** | New features you'd like to see |\n| **Improvement** | Ways to make existing features better |\n| **Question** | General questions about the platform |\n| **Praise** | Let us know what's working well |\n\n## Submitting Feature Requests\n\n### What Makes a Good Feature Request\n\nHelp us understand your needs:\n\n**Include:**\n- What you're trying to accomplish\n- Why current features don't solve it\n- How you envision the solution\n- How often you'd use it\n\n**Example - Good Request:**\n> \"I'd love to be able to filter plays by game situation (red zone, 3rd down, etc.) when selecting plays to tag. Currently I have to scroll through all plays. This would save time during busy game weeks.\"\n\n**Example - Less Helpful:**\n> \"Add more filters.\"\n\n### Feature Request Process\n\n1. **Submit** - Your request is logged\n2. **Review** - We evaluate the request\n3. **Prioritize** - Based on demand and feasibility\n4. **Build** - If approved, added to roadmap\n5. **Release** - You're notified when it ships\n\n### Checking Request Status\n\nCurrently, feature requests are reviewed internally. Major releases include notes on what's new. We're working on a public roadmap.\n\n## Suggesting Improvements\n\n### Types of Improvements\n\n- **Usability** - Making features easier to use\n- **Performance** - Faster loading, smoother experience\n- **Design** - Better layouts, clearer interfaces\n- **Workflow** - Streamlined processes\n\n### How to Describe Improvements\n\nBe specific about the current experience:\n\n> \"When tagging plays, I have to click 6 times to save. It would be faster if there was a 'Save & Next' button to immediately move to the next play.\"\n\n### Screenshots Help\n\nIf you're describing a UI improvement:\n\n- Take a screenshot of the current state\n- Describe what you'd change\n- Mock it up if you can (optional)\n\n## Asking Questions\n\n### Before Asking\n\n1. Check this documentation\n2. Look for tooltips in the app\n3. Review the FAQ section\n\n### Asking Good Questions\n\nInclude context:\n\n- What you're trying to do\n- What you've already tried\n- What happened vs. what you expected\n\n**Example:**\n> \"I'm trying to upload a game video from my iPhone. When I select the file, nothing happens. I expected to see an upload progress bar. I'm using Safari on iOS 17.\"\n\n### Question Response\n\nQuestions submitted via feedback are answered:\n\n- By email to your account address\n- Based on your plan's response time\n- With helpful resources when applicable\n\n## Providing Praise\n\n### Why Praise Matters\n\nPositive feedback helps us:\n\n- Know what's working well\n- Avoid changing things you love\n- Motivate the team\n\n### What to Share\n\n- Features that save you time\n- Moments when the app impressed you\n- Things that \"just work\"\n- Comparisons to previous tools\n\n**Example:**\n> \"The play builder is incredibly intuitive. I was able to digitize our entire playbook in one afternoon. Much better than drawing plays by hand!\"\n\n## Feedback Best Practices\n\n### Be Specific\n\nVague feedback is harder to act on:\n\n- ❌ \"The app is slow\"\n- ✅ \"Video playback stutters when I have 3+ camera angles\"\n\n### One Topic Per Submission\n\nMultiple issues in one message get confused:\n\n- Submit separate feedback for separate topics\n- Each gets proper tracking and attention\n\n### Include Context\n\nHelp us reproduce your experience:\n\n- What device/browser you're using\n- What you were doing when it happened\n- Any error messages you saw\n\n### Be Constructive\n\nWe value all perspectives:\n\n- Focus on the problem and potential solutions\n- Assume we want to help\n- Frustration is understandable, but specifics help more\n\n## What Happens to Your Feedback\n\n### Review Process\n\n1. **Received** - Logged in our system\n2. **Categorized** - Sorted by type and priority\n3. **Analyzed** - Evaluated for feasibility\n4. **Prioritized** - Ranked against other requests\n5. **Addressed** - Fixed, built, or responded to\n\n### You May Receive\n\n- **Acknowledgment** - Confirmation we received it\n- **Follow-up questions** - If we need more details\n- **Status update** - When something changes\n- **Resolution** - When it's addressed\n\n### Feedback Impact\n\nYour feedback has led to:\n\n- New features built by request\n- UI improvements for usability\n- Bug fixes and performance gains\n- Documentation updates\n\n## Feedback FAQ\n\n### Will someone respond?\n\nFor questions and issues, yes. For feature requests, we may not respond individually but all are reviewed.\n\n### How long until my feature is built?\n\nIt depends on complexity, demand, and our roadmap. Some take weeks, others months.\n\n### Can I talk to someone directly?\n\nPremium plans include priority support. Contact us about direct communication options.\n\n### Is my feedback anonymous?\n\nFeedback is associated with your account so we can follow up, but it's kept confidential.\n\n### What if I have urgent feedback?\n\nFor urgent issues, mark them as bugs and include \"URGENT\" in the description.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Report a bug](/guide/support/reporting-bugs) if something isn't working\n- Return to [using the platform](/guide/getting-started/creating-account)\n- Explore features in the [Guide](/guide)\n",

    "content": "\n## Overview\n\nThe Players page is where you manage your team's roster and depth chart. Having your roster set up enables you to track individual player performance when tagging film and generate player-specific analytics.\n\n## Accessing the Roster\n\n1. Navigate to your team dashboard\n2. Click **Players** in the team navigation bar\n3. You'll see your roster list and depth chart options\n\n## View Modes\n\nThe Players page offers two viewing modes:\n\n### Roster View\n\nA complete list of all active players on your team. This view shows:\n\n- Jersey number\n- Player name\n- Position(s)\n- Grade level (if set)\n\nUse the filter buttons to show:\n- **All** - Every player\n- **Offense** - Offensive players only\n- **Defense** - Defensive players only\n- **Special Teams** - Kickers, punters, returners\n\n### Depth Chart View\n\nVisual representation of your starting lineup and backups organized by position. Switch between:\n\n- **Offense** - QB, RBs, WRs, TEs, offensive line\n- **Defense** - DL, LBs, DBs\n- **Special Teams** - K, P, LS, returners\n\n## Adding Players\n\n### Add a Single Player\n\n1. Click the **Add Player** button\n2. Fill in the player details:\n\n| Field | Description | Required |\n|-------|-------------|----------|\n| **Jersey Number** | Player's number | Yes |\n| **First Name** | Player's first name | Yes |\n| **Last Name** | Player's last name | Yes |\n| **Position(s)** | Primary and secondary positions | Yes |\n| **Grade Level** | 6th Grade through Senior | No |\n| **Notes** | Any additional information | No |\n\n3. Set depth chart positions (optional)\n4. Click **Save**\n\n### Position Options\n\n**Offensive Positions:**\n- QB (Quarterback)\n- RB (Running Back)\n- FB (Fullback)\n- X (Split End)\n- Y (Slot/TE)\n- Z (Flanker)\n- TE (Tight End)\n- LT, LG, C, RG, RT (Offensive Line)\n\n**Defensive Positions:**\n- DE (Defensive End)\n- DT (Defensive Tackle)\n- NT (Nose Tackle)\n- LB, MLB, SAM, WILL (Linebackers)\n- LCB, RCB (Cornerbacks)\n- FS, SS, S (Safeties)\n\n**Special Teams Positions:**\n- K (Kicker)\n- P (Punter)\n- LS (Long Snapper)\n- H (Holder)\n- KR (Kick Returner)\n- PR (Punt Returner)\n\n## Managing the Depth Chart\n\n### Setting Depth\n\nWhen adding or editing a player, you can assign their depth at each position:\n\n- **1st String** - Starter\n- **2nd String** - Primary backup\n- **3rd String** - Second backup\n\n### Depth Chart Conflicts\n\nIf you try to assign two players to the same position and depth, you'll see a warning. Resolve conflicts by:\n\n1. Changing the new player's depth\n2. Updating the existing player's depth first\n3. Removing the position from one player\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- Set starters (1st string) first for key positions\n- Two-way players can have positions on both offense and defense\n- Update depth chart after each week based on performance\n\n## Editing Players\n\n1. Find the player in the roster list\n2. Click on their row or the edit button\n3. Update any information\n4. Click **Save**\n\n## Removing Players\n\nTo remove a player from your active roster:\n\n1. Find the player in the roster list\n2. Click the edit button\n3. Toggle **Active** to off (or click **Deactivate**)\n4. The player will be removed from the active roster\n\n> **Note:** Deactivated players are not deleted. Their historical data and stats are preserved.\n\n## Why Roster Management Matters\n\n### Film Tagging\n\nWhen you tag plays with the Standard or Comprehensive tagging levels, you can attribute plays to specific players:\n\n- Who carried the ball\n- Who made the tackle\n- Offensive line assignments\n- Coverage players\n\n### Analytics\n\nWith players set up, you unlock player-specific analytics:\n\n- Individual rushing/receiving stats\n- Tackle leaders\n- Position group performance\n- Player development tracking\n\n### Depth Chart Reports\n\nGenerate reports showing:\n\n- Starting lineup by position\n- Backup depth\n- Two-way player assignments\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n### Start with Starters\n\nYou don't need your entire roster immediately. Start with:\n\n1. All starters (22 players minimum)\n2. Key backups at skill positions\n3. Add remaining players as needed\n\n### Use Consistent Naming\n\n- Enter names the same way every time\n- Use proper capitalization\n- Include jersey numbers for easy identification\n\n### Keep It Updated\n\n- Update the roster when players join or leave\n- Adjust depth chart weekly based on performance\n- Mark injured players in notes\n\n### Grade Levels\n\nSetting grade levels helps you:\n\n- Track player development over seasons\n- Plan for graduation/roster turnover\n- Generate class-specific reports\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Can't Find a Player?\n\n- Check if the filter is set to \"All\"\n- The player may be deactivated - check inactive players\n- Search by jersey number or name\n\n### Depth Chart Not Showing Players?\n\n- Make sure players have positions assigned\n- Check that players have depth (1st, 2nd, 3rd string) set\n- Verify you're viewing the correct unit (offense/defense/special teams)\n\n### Position Not Available?\n\nIf you need a position that's not listed, use the closest equivalent and note the specific role in the player's notes field.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Set up your schedule](/guide/teams/seasons)\n- [Upload game film](/guide/film/uploading-film) to start tracking player performance\n- [Tag plays](/guide/film/tagging-plays) with player attribution\n",

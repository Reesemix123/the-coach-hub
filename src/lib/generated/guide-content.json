    "content": "\n## Overview\n\nYouth Coach Hub supports multiple camera angles for each game, allowing you to see plays from different perspectives. Upload footage from sideline cameras, end zone cameras, or any other angles you capture, then sync them together for seamless playback.\n\n## Why Use Multiple Cameras?\n\nDifferent angles reveal different details:\n\n| Camera Position | Best For |\n|-----------------|----------|\n| **Sideline (Wide)** | Overall play development, routes, coverage |\n| **End Zone** | Offensive/defensive line play, blocking schemes |\n| **Tight Sideline** | Ball carrier, tackle points, individual players |\n| **Press Box** | All-22 view, secondary coverage |\n\n## Camera Limits by Plan\n\nThe number of cameras you can upload per game depends on your subscription:\n\n| Plan | Camera Limit |\n|------|--------------|\n| Basic | 1 camera |\n| Plus | 3 cameras |\n| Premium | 5 cameras |\n\n> **Tip:** You can upgrade your plan at any time to add more camera angles.\n\n---\n\n## Adding Camera Angles\n\n### Uploading Your First Camera\n\n1. Navigate to **Film** in your team dashboard\n2. Select or create a game\n3. Click **Upload Video** or drag a file into the upload area\n4. This becomes your **Primary Camera**\n\n### Adding Additional Cameras\n\n1. In the film viewer, find the **Camera Angles** section\n2. Click **Add Camera**\n3. Select or drag your video file\n4. The upload begins and shows progress\n5. Once processed, the new camera appears in the row\n\n### Camera Status Indicators\n\n| Status | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Pending** | Upload queued |\n| **Processing** | Video being processed |\n| **Ready** | Available for playback |\n| **Failed** | Upload error - retry needed |\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the Camera Row\n\nThe Camera Row displays all angles for your game:\n\n### Primary Camera\n\n- Marked with a **PRIMARY** badge\n- Always Camera 1 in the order\n- Used as the reference for syncing other cameras\n- Play tags are tied to the primary camera's timeline\n\n### Secondary Cameras\n\n- Appear after the primary camera\n- Show sync offset status\n- Can be reordered if needed\n\n### Camera Information\n\nEach camera thumbnail shows:\n\n- Camera label (customizable)\n- Duration\n- Sync offset (if not the primary)\n- Processing status\n\n---\n\n## Syncing Cameras\n\nSyncing ensures all camera angles show the same moment simultaneously. This is essential for switching between angles during playback.\n\n### Why Sync?\n\nCameras often start recording at different times. Without syncing:\n\n- Switching angles jumps to a different moment\n- Comparing plays across angles is difficult\n- Tagging becomes inconsistent\n\n### The Sync Process\n\nYouth Coach Hub uses a two-step sync process:\n\n#### Step 1: Mark the Primary Camera\n\n1. Click **Sync Cameras** in the Camera Row\n2. The Sync Modal opens with your primary camera\n3. Play the video to find a recognizable moment:\n   - Ball snap\n   - Whistle blow\n   - Big hit\n   - Any clear visual/audio cue\n4. Use the playback controls to find the exact frame\n5. Click **Mark This Moment**\n\n#### Step 2: Match on Secondary Cameras\n\n1. For each secondary camera, click **Sync**\n2. Find the **same moment** you marked on the primary\n3. Use playback controls to match it precisely\n4. Click **Mark & Save Sync**\n5. Repeat for each secondary camera\n\n### Playback Controls in Sync\n\n| Control | Action |\n|---------|--------|\n| Play/Pause | Toggle playback |\n| -5s / +5s | Jump 5 seconds |\n| -1s / +1s | Fine-tune by 1 second |\n\n### Sync Offset Explained\n\nAfter syncing, each camera shows an offset:\n\n- **+3s** means this camera started 3 seconds *after* the primary\n- **-5s** means this camera started 5 seconds *before* the primary\n- **Synced** (0s) means cameras started at the same time\n\n### Re-syncing a Camera\n\nIf sync seems off:\n\n1. Click **Sync Cameras**\n2. Find the camera\n3. Click **Re-sync**\n4. Repeat the matching process\n\n---\n\n## Switching Camera Angles\n\n### During Playback\n\n1. Click on any camera thumbnail to switch\n2. Playback automatically adjusts for sync offset\n3. The selected camera shows a blue highlight\n\n### While Tagging\n\n- Switch cameras to see different angles of the same play\n- Tags are saved to the primary camera's timeline\n- Sync ensures you're viewing the correct moment\n\n---\n\n## Camera Labels\n\nGive meaningful names to your cameras:\n\n### Editing Camera Labels\n\n1. In the Camera Row, each camera shows a default label\n2. Click the label to edit (if available)\n3.

    "content": "\n## Overview\n\nYouth Coach Hub enforces storage limits to ensure fair usage and reliable performance. These limits apply at three levels: your total team storage, per-game storage, and per-camera duration.\n\n## Storage Limits by Plan\n\n### Team Total Storage\n\nYour plan determines how much total film storage your team can use across all games:\n\n| Plan | Total Storage |\n|------|---------------|\n| Basic | 10 GB |\n| Plus | 50 GB |\n| Premium | 200 GB |\n\nThis is the combined size of all video files uploaded to your team, across all games.\n\n### Per-Game Limits\n\nEach individual game also has storage and duration limits:\n\n| Plan | Max Storage Per Game | Max Duration Per Game |\n|------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Basic | 5 GB | 3 hours |\n| Plus | 15 GB | 9 hours |\n| Premium | 25 GB | 15 hours |\n\nThese limits prevent any single game from consuming too much of your total storage.\n\n### Per-Camera Limits\n\nWhen using multiple cameras, each camera angle is limited to **3 hours** of video regardless of your plan. This applies whether you upload a single long video or combine multiple clips.\n\n| Plan | Cameras Per Game | Per-Camera Duration |\n|------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Basic | 1 | 3 hours |\n| Plus | 3 | 3 hours each |\n| Premium | 5 | 3 hours each |\n\n---\n\n## How Storage Is Calculated\n\n### File Size\n\nStorage is measured by the actual file size of your uploaded videos. A typical game video might be:\n\n- **Low quality (720p, 5 Mbps):** ~2 GB per hour\n- **Standard quality (1080p, 10 Mbps):** ~4.5 GB per hour\n- **High quality (1080p, 15 Mbps):** ~6.5 GB per hour\n\n### Duration\n\nVideo duration is detected automatically when you upload. If you use the timeline editor to combine multiple clips on a camera, the total duration of all clips counts toward your per-camera limit.\n\n---\n\n## Checking Your Storage Usage\n\n### Team Storage on the Film Page\n\nWhen viewing any game's film, you'll see a **storage indicator** in the status bar at the top of the page (next to the score and plays tagged count). This compact indicator shows:\n\n- Total storage used vs. your quota (e.g., \"2.5 GB / 10 GB\")\n- Percentage of quota used\n- Color-coded progress bar:\n  - **Green:** Normal usage\n  - **Amber:** 80%+ usage (running low)\n  - **Red:** Quota exceeded\n\nThe storage indicator updates automatically after uploads and deletions.\n\n### Warning Messages\n\nWhen your storage is running low (80%+ used), the indicator turns amber as a warning. If you exceed your quota, the indicator turns red and displays a message explaining that you need to delete videos or upgrade your plan to continue uploading.\n\n---\n\n## What Happens When You Hit a Limit\n\n### Team Storage Full\n\nIf your team's total storage is full:\n\n- New uploads will be blocked\n- You'll see a message explaining the limit\n- Options: Delete old games, upgrade your plan, or wait for games to expire\n\n### Game Storage Full\n\nIf a game reaches its storage limit:\n\n- Additional uploads to that game are blocked\n- You can still upload to other games\n- Consider compressing videos or removing unused footage\n\n### Camera Duration Exceeded\n\nIf a camera reaches its 3-hour limit:\n\n- Additional clips cannot be added to that camera lane\n- You can add clips to other cameras (if you haven't reached the per-game camera limit)\n- Remove or trim existing clips to free up duration\n\n---\n\n## Managing Your Storage\n\n### Tips for Efficient Storage Use\n\n**Compress Before Upload:**\n- Use HandBrake (free) or your video editing software\n- Target 10-12 Mbps bitrate for good quality at reasonable file size\n- 1080p resolution is sufficient for film review\n\n**Remove Unused Footage:**\n- Delete pre-game warmups and post-game footage\n- Trim halftime from your videos before uploading\n- Focus on game action only\n\n**Use Game Expiration:**\n- Games automatically expire based on your plan's retention period\n- Basic: 30 days, Plus: 180 days, Premium: 365 days\n- Expired games free up storage automatically\n\n### Deleting Videos\n\nTo free up storage:\n\n1. Go to the game's film page\n2. Find the video you want to remove\n3. Click the delete option\n4. Confirm deletion\n\n> **Warning:** Deleted videos cannot be recovered. Any play tags linked to the video will also be removed.\n\n---\n\n## Upgrading for More Storage\n\nIf you consistently hit storage limits, consider upgrading your plan:\n\n| Upgrade | Storage Increase | Additional Benefits |\n|---------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Basic to Plus | 10 GB → 50 GB | 3 cameras, 180-day retention |\n| Plus to Premium | 50 GB → 200 GB | 5 cameras, 365-day retention |\n\n[Compare all plan features](/guide/subscriptions/tier-comparison)\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Why is there a per-game limit?\n\nPer-game limits ensure that no single game monopolizes your storage quota. This helps you maintain film for multiple games throughout the season rather than running out of space after a few uploads.\n\n### Does the per-camera limit apply to combined clips?\n\nYes. If you use the timeline editor to combine multiple video clips on one camera lane, the total duration of all clips counts toward the 3-hour per-camera limit.\n\n### What counts toward my storage?\n\nOnly successfully uploaded video files count toward your storage. Failed or cancelled uploads don't consume storage.\n\n### Do play tags use storage?\n\nNo. Play tags are metadata and don't count toward your storage quota. You can tag as many plays as you want without affecting storage.\n\n### What happens to my storage if I downgrade?\n\nIf you downgrade to a plan with less storage:\n\n- Your existing files remain but may exceed your new quota\n- You won't be able to upload new videos until you're under the limit\n- Consider deleting old games before downgrading\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Upload your game film](/guide/film/uploading-film)\n- [Set up multiple cameras](/guide/film/multi-camera)\n- [Compare subscription plans](/guide/subscriptions/tier-comparison)\n",

Click on a video to open the film viewer\n\n### Basic Tagging Workflow\n\n1. **Play the video** until you reach the start of a play\n2. Click **Mark Start** to set the play's beginning\n3. Let the play run, then click **Mark End**\n4. Fill in the play details in the tagging form\n5. Click **Save Play** to record the tag\n\n## Understanding Tagging Levels\n\nYouth Coach Hub offers different levels of detail based on your needs:\n\n### Quick\n\n*Track the game, remember the season* (~15-20 sec per play)\n\nCapture game essentials without the time investment:\n\n- Quarter and time\n- Ball carrier\n- Yards gained\n- Result (touchdown, first down, etc.)\n- Turnovers and big plays\n\n### Standard\n\n*Understand what's working, prepare for next week* (~30-45 sec per play)\n\nAdd play-level context to see which plays succeed:\n\n- All Quick fields\n- Down and distance\n- Formation and play type\n- QB and target (for passes)\n- Drive tracking\n- Situational tendencies\n\n### Comprehensive\n\n*Evaluate and develop every player* (~2-3 min per play)\n\nFull player-level tracking for detailed analysis:\n\n- All Standard fields\n- Position-by-position grades for all offensive players\n- Position-by-position grades for all defensive players\n- Situational tags (motion, blitz, etc.)\n- Coverage information\n\n## Play Details\n\n### Context Fields\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Down | 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th down |\n| Distance | Yards needed for first down |\n| Yard Line | Field position (1-99) |\n| Hash | Left, middle, or right hash |\n\n### Result Fields\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Yards Gained | Net yards on the play |\n| Result | Outcome (complete, incomplete, run, etc.) |\n| First Down | Did the play result in a first down? |\n| Turnover | Was there a fumble or interception? |\n\n## Auto-Population\n\nYouth Coach Hub automatically calculates the next play's context based on the previous play:\n\n- **Down** advances automatically\n- **Distance** adjusts based on yards gained and penalties\n- **Yard Line** updates based on the result\n\nAuto-populated fields are highlighted in blue. You can always override these values manually.\n\n> **Tip:** If a penalty was declined, check the \"Penalty Declined\" box so it doesn't affect the next play's calculations.\n\n## Tagging Tips\n\n### Be Consistent\n\nUse the same criteria for success/failure across all plays. This ensures your analytics are meaningful.\n\n### Tag Both Teams\n\nTag both your offensive plays and opponent's plays. This gives you:\n\n- Defensive analytics for your team\n- Scouting data on opponents\n\n### Use Drives\n\nGroup plays into drives to see:\n\n- Points per drive\n- Drive efficiency\n- Red zone performance\n\n### Review Your Tags\n\nPeriodically review tagged plays to ensure accuracy. Incorrect tags lead to incorrect analytics.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nSpeed up tagging with these shortcuts:\n\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| `Space` | Play/Pause video |\n| `[` | Mark play start |\n| `]` | Mark play end |\n| `Enter` | Save play |\n| `Left Arrow` | Rewind 5 seconds |\n| `Right Arrow` | Forward 5 seconds |\n",

Export or print your organized call sheet\n\n## QB Wristband Printout\n\nThe wristband is the QB's quick reference on the field - a condensed version of the call sheet that fits on their arm.\n\n### What Goes on the Wristband\n\nKeep it simple and scannable:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────┐\n│     GAME DAY WRISTBAND      │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ 1ST DOWN                    │\n│ 11-IZ  12-OZ  13-PA  14-CF  │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ 2ND MED                     │\n│ 21-CTR 22-SL  23-DRW 24-SCR │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ 3RD SHORT                   │\n│ 31-PWR 32-SNK 33-SLT        │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ 3RD MEDIUM                  │\n│ 41-MSH 42-LVL 43-STK        │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ RED ZONE                    │\n│ 51-SPO 52-FD  53-PWR 54-PA  │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│ GOAL LINE                   │\n│ 61-SNK 62-DIV 63-BT  64-FD  │\n└─────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Creating the Wristband\n\n1. Go to **Game Week > Wristband Builder**\n2. Your call sheet plays auto-populate\n3. Assign short codes (2-3 characters) to each play\n4. Organize by situation category\n5. Print to wristband-sized format\n\n### Wristband Best Practices\n\n- **Use consistent codes** - Same abbreviations every game\n- **Limit choices** - 3-5 plays per situation max\n- **Number system** - First digit = situation, second = play option\n- **Practice with it** - QB should use wristband in practice\n\n## Coach's Sideline Sheet\n\nA larger format for the play-caller with more detail:\n\n```\nOPPONENT TENDENCIES\n- 1st Down: 60% run, favor inside zone\n- 3rd & Medium: 70% Cover 3, 30% blitz\n- Red Zone: Heavy sets, power run\n\nCALL SHEET BY SITUATION\n[Full play names with formation and motion calls]\n\nADJUSTMENTS\n- vs Cover 3: Attack seams, use out routes\n- vs Man: Motion to create picks, quick game\n- vs Pressure: Slide protection, hot routes\n\nKEY REMINDERS\n- Their #24 is their best cover corner\n- They substitute on 3rd down - watch for nickel\n- QB likes to scramble right under pressure\n```\n\n### Printing Options\n\nExport your preparation materials:\n\n- **Full Call Sheet** - Letter size, detailed\n- **QB Wristband** - Wristband card format\n- **Sideline Reference** - Laminated coaching sheet\n- **Adjustment Card** - Quick if/then reference\n\n## In-Game Adjustments\n\n### First Quarter Observations\n\nUse the first quarter to validate your preparation:\n\n- Are they doing what you expected?\n- What's different from the film?\n- What adjustments do you need to make?\n\n### Halftime Analysis\n\nAt halftime, quickly review:\n\n- What's working? Do more of it.\n- What's not working? Adjust or abandon.\n- What are they doing differently? Counter it.\n\n### Second Half Execution\n\nApply your adjustments:\n\n- Call plays that attack what you're seeing\n- Avoid plays that aren't working\n- Trust your preparation\n\n## Post-Game: Complete the Cycle\n\nAfter the game, the cycle continues:\n\n### Immediate Notes\n\nWhile it's fresh, note:\n\n- What adjustments worked?\n- What didn't go as planned?\n- What do you need to practice?\n\n### Film Review Priorities\n\nWhen you review film:\n\n- Tag the game for your analytics\n- Identify coaching points for players\n- Note opponent tendencies for future reference\n\n### Update Your Data\n\nYour post-game film tagging:\n\n- Updates your team's analytics\n- Adds to your play-by-play history\n- Improves future game preparation\n\n## The Confidence of Preparation\n\nWhen you walk onto the field:\n\n- You've studied your opponent thoroughly\n- You know your team's strengths and weaknesses\n- You have data-backed play calls for every situation\n- You've practiced against realistic looks\n- You have adjustments ready for what they'll show\n\nThis is the competitive advantage of preparation. You're not guessing - you're making informed decisions based on evidence.\n\n> **The Final Word:** Game Day Ready isn't about having all the answers. It's about having done the work so you can trust your decisions and coach your players with confidence. That's what Youth Coach Hub helps you achieve.\n",

    "content": "\n## Where Data Becomes Coaching\n\nGame Week Preparation is where everything comes together. All the film you've tagged, all the plays you've built, and all the analytics you've generated culminate here. This is where data transforms into the insights and preparation that help you show up ready to coach well when it matters most.\n\n## The Preparation Workflow\n\nYouth Coach Hub guides you through a structured preparation process:\n\n### 1. Review Your Data\n\nBefore you can prepare, you need to understand what you're working with:\n\n- **Your team's tendencies** - What plays work best in which situations?\n- **Success rates by formation** - Where are you most effective?\n- **Down and distance patterns** - What do you typically call on 3rd and long?\n- **Red zone performance** - How do you score when it matters?\n\n### 2. Scout the Opponent\n\nIf you've tagged opponent film from previous games:\n\n- **Defensive tendencies** - What coverage do they run most often?\n- **Blitz patterns** - When and how do they bring pressure?\n- **Personnel groupings** - How do they substitute?\n- **Weaknesses to exploit** - Where can your offense attack?\n\n### 3. Build Your Game Plan\n\nArmed with data, you can make informed decisions:\n\n- Select plays that match up well against their defense\n- Identify key adjustments based on what you expect to see\n- Prepare answers for their most common looks\n- Focus practice time on situational execution\n\n### 4. Prepare Your Team\n\nTurn your game plan into practice:\n\n- Install scripts based on expected opponent tendencies\n- Walk through adjustments your players need to recognize\n- Build confidence with data-backed play calling\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nMost coaches rely on gut feeling and memory. Youth Coach Hub gives you:\n\n| Traditional Approach | With Youth Coach Hub |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| \"I think they run Cover 3\" | \"They run Cover 3 on 68% of passing downs\" |\n| \"We should run more\" | \"Our run game averages 5.2 YPC from 12 personnel\" |\n| \"They blitz a lot\" | \"They blitz 45% on 3rd and 6+\" |\n| \"We struggle in the red zone\" | \"Red zone TD% is 42% - passing is 55%, rushing is 31%\" |\n\n## The Competitive Edge\n\nWhen you walk onto the field on game day:\n\n- You know exactly what your team does well\n- You understand your opponent's patterns\n- You have data-backed answers for situations\n- Your players have practiced against realistic looks\n\nThis isn't about replacing coaching instincts - it's about informing them with evidence so you can make better decisions under pressure.\n\n> **The Bottom Line:** Game Week Preparation is where Youth Coach Hub delivers its greatest value. All the tagging, all the analytics - they exist to help you coach better when the game is on the line.\n",

Review opponent's most common plays\n2. Build a card system based on their tendencies\n3. Have scout team run realistic looks\n\n## Practice Period Structure\n\n### Individual Periods\n\nFocus on technique work informed by film review:\n\n- Position-specific corrections from game film\n- Skill development for weaknesses identified in analytics\n- Repetition of fundamentals that lead to success\n\n### Team Periods\n\nStructure team reps around game-like situations:\n\n**Situational Practice Ideas:**\n\n| Period | Focus | Data Source |\n|--------|-------|-------------|\n| 3rd Down | Converting/Stopping | 3rd down success rates |\n| Red Zone | Scoring/Defending | Red zone efficiency |\n| 2-Minute | Clock management | Drive analytics |\n| Goal Line | Short yardage | Goal-to-go conversion |\n\n### Scrimmage Periods\n\nCreate game-realistic scenarios:\n\n- Start at specific down/distance/field position\n- Use opponent tendencies for defensive looks\n- Track success just like a game\n\n## Tracking Practice to Game Correlation\n\nOver time, you can see if practice is translating:\n\n- Are plays you rep heavily performing better?\n- Are situations you focus on improving?\n- Is there carryover from practice to games?\n\n## Weekly Practice Flow\n\nUse your analytics to structure each day's focus:\n\n| Day | Focus | Data Source |\n|-----|-------|-------------|\n| **Monday** | Film review, corrections | Previous game analytics |\n| **Tuesday** | Priority situations | Success rate by situation |\n| **Wednesday** | Team execution | Game plan plays, opponent tendencies |\n| **Thursday** | Fine-tuning | Remaining weak spots |\n| **Friday** | Mental reps | Walk through key plays |\n\n> **Tip:** Use [practice templates](/guide/practice/templates) to save your weekly structure and customize each week based on what your data tells you.\n\n> **Remember:** The goal isn't to practice everything - it's to practice the right things.

Every play you've tagged about your opponent contributes to a clearer picture of what you'll face on game day.\n\n## Generating a Scouting Report\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo generate a meaningful scouting report, you need:\n\n- At least one game with opponent plays tagged\n- Basic tagging data (formation, play type, result)\n- Ideally 20+ plays for statistical significance\n\n### Creating the Report\n\n1. Navigate to **Game Week** from your team dashboard\n2. Select **Scouting Reports**\n3. Choose the opponent you're preparing for\n4. Select which games to include in the analysis\n5. Click **Generate Report**\n\n## What the Report Shows\n\n### Defensive Tendencies\n\nIf you're scouting their defense:\n\n| Metric | What It Tells You |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Base Formation % | What defense do they line up in most? |\n| Coverage Distribution | Man vs Zone breakdown |\n| Blitz Rate by Down | When do they bring pressure? |\n| Tendencies by Hash | Do they favor certain looks by field position? |\n\n### Offensive Tendencies\n\nIf you're scouting their offense:\n\n| Metric | What It Tells You |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Run/Pass Ratio | Are they run-heavy or pass-happy? |\n| Personnel Groupings | What formations do they favor? |\n| Play Type by Down | What do they call on 1st down vs 3rd? |\n| Key Players | Who gets the ball most often? |\n\n### Situational Analysis\n\nThe report breaks down tendencies by situation:\n\n- **Early Downs** (1st & 2nd) - What's their approach when ahead of schedule?\n- **Third Down** - How do they convert? What do they call?\n- **Red Zone** - How do they try to score?\n- **Goal Line** - What's their go-to play?\n- **Two-Minute** - How do they operate under time pressure?\n\n## Using the Data\n\n### Identify Exploitable Patterns\n\nLook for:\n\n- **Predictable tendencies** - Do they always run on 1st down?\n- **Coverage tells** - Does their safety alignment give away the coverage?\n- **Personnel-based patterns** - Do certain players only come in for certain plays?\n\n### Prepare Counter-Strategies\n\nFor each tendency you identify:\n\n1. Note the pattern\n2. Select plays from your playbook that attack it\n3. Practice recognition and execution\n\n### Create Game Day Notes\n\nExport key insights to a condensed format you can reference during the game:\n\n- Top 5 things to remember\n- Adjustments by situation\n- Key players to watch\n\n## Building Better Reports Over Time\n\nThe more opponent film you tag, the better your scouting reports become:\n\n- **Multiple games** reveal consistent tendencies vs. one-game anomalies\n- **Detailed tagging** (Standard or Comprehensive) provides richer analysis\n- **Personnel tracking** shows substitution patterns\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Tag opponent film immediately after games while it's fresh. The data you collect throughout the season makes your playoff scouting reports invaluable.\n",

Check this documentation\n2. Look for tooltips in the app\n3. Review the FAQ section\n\n### Asking Good Questions\n\nInclude context:\n\n- What you're trying to do\n- What you've already tried\n- What happened vs. what you expected\n\n**Example:**\n> \"I'm trying to upload a game video from my iPhone. When I select the file, nothing happens. I expected to see an upload progress bar. I'm using Safari on iOS 17.\"\n\n### Question Response\n\nQuestions submitted via feedback are answered:\n\n- By email to your account address\n- Based on your plan's response time\n- With helpful resources when applicable\n\n## Providing Praise\n\n### Why Praise Matters\n\nPositive feedback helps us:\n\n- Know what's working well\n- Avoid changing things you love\n- Motivate the team\n\n### What to Share\n\n- Features that save you time\n- Moments when the app impressed you\n- Things that \"just work\"\n- Comparisons to previous tools\n\n**Example:**\n> \"The play builder is incredibly intuitive. I was able to digitize our entire playbook in one afternoon. Much better than drawing plays by hand!\"\n\n## Feedback Best Practices\n\n### Be Specific\n\nVague feedback is harder to act on:\n\n- ❌ \"The app is slow\"\n- ✅ \"Video playback stutters when I have 3+ camera angles\"\n\n### One Topic Per Submission\n\nMultiple issues in one message get confused:\n\n- Submit separate feedback for separate topics\n- Each gets proper tracking and attention\n\n### Include Context\n\nHelp us reproduce your experience:\n\n- What device/browser you're using\n- What you were doing when it happened\n- Any error messages you saw\n\n### Be Constructive\n\nWe value all perspectives:\n\n- Focus on the problem and potential solutions\n- Assume we want to help\n- Frustration is understandable, but specifics help more\n\n## What Happens to Your Feedback\n\n### Review Process\n\n1. **Received** - Logged in our system\n2. **Categorized** - Sorted by type and priority\n3. **Analyzed** - Evaluated for feasibility\n4. **Prioritized** - Ranked against other requests\n5. **Addressed** - Fixed, built, or responded to\n\n### You May Receive\n\n- **Acknowledgment** - Confirmation we received it\n- **Follow-up questions** - If we need more details\n- **Status update** - When something changes\n- **Resolution** - When it's addressed\n\n### Feedback Impact\n\nYour feedback has led to:\n\n- New features built by request\n- UI improvements for usability\n- Bug fixes and performance gains\n- Documentation updates\n\n## Feedback FAQ\n\n### Will someone respond?\n\nFor questions and issues, yes. For feature requests, we may not respond individually but all are reviewed.\n\n### How long until my feature is built?\n\nIt depends on complexity, demand, and our roadmap. Some take weeks, others months.\n\n### Can I talk to someone directly?\n\nPremium plans include priority support. Contact us about direct communication options.\n\n### Is my feedback anonymous?\n\nFeedback is associated with your account so we can follow up, but it's kept confidential.\n\n### What if I have urgent feedback?\n\nFor urgent issues, mark them as bugs and include \"URGENT\" in the description.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Report a bug](/guide/support/reporting-bugs) if something isn't working\n- Return to [using the platform](/guide/getting-started/creating-account)\n- Explore features in the [Guide](/guide)\n",

    "content": "\n## Overview\n\nThe Players page is where you manage your team's roster and depth chart. Having your roster set up enables you to track individual player performance when tagging film and generate player-specific analytics.\n\n## Accessing the Roster\n\n1. Navigate to your team dashboard\n2. Click **Players** in the team navigation bar\n3. You'll see your roster list and depth chart options\n\n## View Modes\n\nThe Players page offers two viewing modes:\n\n### Roster View\n\nA complete list of all active players on your team. This view shows:\n\n- Jersey number\n- Player name\n- Position(s)\n- Grade level (if set)\n\nUse the filter buttons to show:\n- **All** - Every player\n- **Offense** - Offensive players only\n- **Defense** - Defensive players only\n- **Special Teams** - Kickers, punters, returners\n\n### Depth Chart View\n\nVisual representation of your starting lineup and backups organized by position. Switch between:\n\n- **Offense** - QB, RBs, WRs, TEs, offensive line\n- **Defense** - DL, LBs, DBs\n- **Special Teams** - K, P, LS, returners\n\n## Adding Players\n\n### Add a Single Player\n\n1. Click the **Add Player** button\n2. Fill in the player details:\n\n| Field | Description | Required |\n|-------|-------------|----------|\n| **Jersey Number** | Player's number | Yes |\n| **First Name** | Player's first name | Yes |\n| **Last Name** | Player's last name | Yes |\n| **Position(s)** | Primary and secondary positions | Yes |\n| **Grade Level** | 6th Grade through Senior | No |\n| **Notes** | Any additional information | No |\n\n3. Set depth chart positions (optional)\n4. Click **Save**\n\n### Position Options\n\n**Offensive Positions:**\n- QB (Quarterback)\n- RB (Running Back)\n- FB (Fullback)\n- X (Split End)\n- Y (Slot/TE)\n- Z (Flanker)\n- TE (Tight End)\n- LT, LG, C, RG, RT (Offensive Line)\n\n**Defensive Positions:**\n- DE (Defensive End)\n- DT (Defensive Tackle)\n- NT (Nose Tackle)\n- LB, MLB, SAM, WILL (Linebackers)\n- LCB, RCB (Cornerbacks)\n- FS, SS, S (Safeties)\n\n**Special Teams Positions:**\n- K (Kicker)\n- P (Punter)\n- LS (Long Snapper)\n- H (Holder)\n- KR (Kick Returner)\n- PR (Punt Returner)\n\n## Managing the Depth Chart\n\n### Setting Depth\n\nWhen adding or editing a player, you can assign their depth at each position:\n\n- **1st String** - Starter\n- **2nd String** - Primary backup\n- **3rd String** - Second backup\n\n### Depth Chart Conflicts\n\nIf you try to assign two players to the same position and depth, you'll see a warning. Resolve conflicts by:\n\n1. Changing the new player's depth\n2. Updating the existing player's depth first\n3. Removing the position from one player\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- Set starters (1st string) first for key positions\n- Two-way players can have positions on both offense and defense\n- Update depth chart after each week based on performance\n\n## Editing Players\n\n1. Find the player in the roster list\n2. Click on their row or the edit button\n3. Update any information\n4. Click **Save**\n\n## Removing Players\n\nTo remove a player from your active roster:\n\n1. Find the player in the roster list\n2. Click the edit button\n3. Toggle **Active** to off (or click **Deactivate**)\n4. The player will be removed from the active roster\n\n> **Note:** Deactivated players are not deleted. Their historical data and stats are preserved.\n\n## Why Roster Management Matters\n\n### Film Tagging\n\nWhen you tag plays with the Standard or Comprehensive tagging levels, you can attribute plays to specific players:\n\n- Who carried the ball\n- Who made the tackle\n- Offensive line assignments\n- Coverage players\n\n### Analytics\n\nWith players set up, you unlock player-specific analytics:\n\n- Individual rushing/receiving stats\n- Tackle leaders\n- Position group performance\n- Player development tracking\n\n### Depth Chart Reports\n\nGenerate reports showing:\n\n- Starting lineup by position\n- Backup depth\n- Two-way player assignments\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n### Start with Starters\n\nYou don't need your entire roster immediately. Start with:\n\n1. All starters (22 players minimum)\n2. Key backups at skill positions\n3. Add remaining players as needed\n\n### Use Consistent Naming\n\n- Enter names the same way every time\n- Use proper capitalization\n- Include jersey numbers for easy identification\n\n### Keep It Updated\n\n- Update the roster when players join or leave\n- Adjust depth chart weekly based on performance\n- Mark injured players in notes\n\n### Grade Levels\n\nSetting grade levels helps you:\n\n- Track player development over seasons\n- Plan for graduation/roster turnover\n- Generate class-specific reports\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Can't Find a Player?\n\n- Check if the filter is set to \"All\"\n- The player may be deactivated - check inactive players\n- Search by jersey number or name\n\n### Depth Chart Not Showing Players?\n\n- Make sure players have positions assigned\n- Check that players have depth (1st, 2nd, 3rd string) set\n- Verify you're viewing the correct unit (offense/defense/special teams)\n\n### Position Not Available?\n\nIf you need a position that's not listed, use the closest equivalent and note the specific role in the player's notes field.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Set up your schedule](/guide/teams/schedule)\n- [Upload game film](/guide/film/uploading-film) to start tracking player performance\n- [Tag plays](/guide/film/tagging-plays) with player attribution\n",

## Overview

Coaches can be invited to collaborate on your team with full coaching access. This guide covers the Coach role and what it allows you to do.

## Coach Capabilities

### Full Coaching Access

As a Coach, you have access to:

- Create and edit plays in the playbook
- Upload game film
- Tag plays with full detail
- View and analyze team analytics
- Manage the roster (add/edit players)
- Update the schedule (add games, record results)
- Access team settings

### Cannot Do

Only the Owner / Head Coach can:

- Invite or remove team members
- Access billing or subscription
- Delete the team
- Change other members' roles

## Who Should Be a Coach?

The Coach role is ideal for:

- Assistant coaches
- Offensive/defensive coordinators
- Position coaches
- Graduate assistants
- Trusted volunteers with full responsibilities

## Day-to-Day Workflow

As a Coach, your typical activities include:

1. **Film Review** - Upload and tag game film
2. **Playbook Management** - Create and organize plays
3. **Analytics Review** - Analyze performance data
4. **Roster Updates** - Maintain player information
5. **Schedule Management** - Add games and record results

## Joining a Team

### Accepting an Invitation

When you're invited to a team:

1. You'll receive an email invitation
2. Click the link in the email
3. Create an account (or log in if you have one)
4. You're automatically added to the team

### Accessing the Team

Once joined:

1. Log in to Youth Coach Hub
2. You'll see the team in your dashboard
3. Click on the team to access it

### Multiple Teams

You can be a member of multiple teams:

- Different roles on different teams
- Switch between teams in the dashboard
- Each team is separate (different data, subscriptions)

## Best Practices

### Coordinate with Your Team

- Follow tagging conventions set by the head coach
- Communicate about film uploads to avoid duplicates
- Maintain consistency with team standards
- Coordinate on playbook organization

### Communication

Since you can't manage team membership:

- Contact the Owner / Head Coach for access issues
- Report problems to someone who can address them

## Requesting Different Access

### Need Owner Access?

If you need owner-level permissions:

1. Contact the Owner / Head Coach
2. Explain what you need to do
3. They can update your role from Team Settings

### Role Changes Take Effect Immediately

Once the owner changes your role:

- New permissions are active right away
- No need to log out and back in
- Access updates across all devices

## Common Questions

### Can I see who else is on the team?

Yes, all team members can see the team roster and member list in Team Settings.

### Can I leave a team?

Yes, you can remove yourself from a team through your account settings.

### What if I'm on multiple teams?

You'll see all your teams in your dashboard. Each team is completely separate.

### Can I be an Owner on one team and Coach on another?

Yes, your role is specific to each team. You might own your varsity team and be a coach on the JV team.

### What happens if the owner removes me?

You'll lose access to that team immediately. Your account remains active for other teams.

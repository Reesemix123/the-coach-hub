## Overview

As a team owner, you can invite coaches and staff to collaborate on your team. This guide covers the complete workflow for managing team members - from invitation to removal.

## Accessing Member Management

### Navigate to Team Settings

1. Go to your team dashboard
2. Click **Settings** in the team navigation
3. Select the **Members** tab

### Members Dashboard

The Members tab shows:

- All current team members
- Their assigned roles
- Status (Active or the date they joined)
- Pending invitations in a separate section

## Inviting New Members

### Step 1: Start the Invitation

1. Go to **Team Settings > Members**
2. Click **Invite Coach**

### Step 2: Enter Details

1. Enter the person's email address
2. Select their role:
   - **Owner** - Full team control and billing access
   - **Coach** - Full coaching access (plays, film, roster, analytics)

### Step 3: Send the Invitation

1. Review the details
2. Click **Send Invite**
3. An email is sent to the invitee

### What the Invitee Receives

The invitation email includes:

- Your team name
- Their assigned role
- A secure link to accept the invitation
- Instructions for next steps

### Inviting Users Without Accounts

You can invite anyone - they don't need an existing account:

1. Enter their email and send the invite
2. They receive an email with a signup link
3. After creating their account, they're automatically added to your team
4. No extra steps required on their part

## Managing Pending Invitations

Pending invitations appear in a separate section below your active members.

### Available Actions

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Copy Link** | Copy the invite URL to share directly |
| **Resend** | Send another email with the invitation |
| **Cancel** | Revoke the invitation (link becomes invalid) |

### Using Copy Link

If the email isn't getting through:

1. Click **Copy Link** on the pending invite
2. Share the link via text, Slack, or other messaging
3. The coach can use the link just like clicking from email

### Invitation Expiration

- Invitations expire after **7 days**
- Use **Resend** to send a fresh invitation
- Canceled invitations cannot be reactivated (send a new one)

## Changing Member Roles

### When to Change Roles

You might change a role when:

- Promoting a coach to owner
- Adjusting responsibilities
- Transferring team ownership

### How to Change a Role

1. Find the member in the Members list
2. Click the dropdown next to their current role
3. Select the new role
4. Changes take effect immediately

### Role Changes Are Immediate

- New permissions take effect instantly
- No action required by the member
- They'll see their new access right away

## Removing Team Members

### When to Remove Members

Remove members when:

- A coach leaves the program
- Someone no longer needs access
- Cleaning up old accounts
- Security concerns arise

### How to Remove a Member

1. Find the member in the Members list
2. Click **Remove**
3. Confirm the removal

### What Happens When Removed

- **Immediate** loss of access
- Cannot see team content anymore
- Their contributions remain (tagged plays, etc.)
- They can be re-invited later if needed

## Best Practices

### Invite Thoughtfully

- Only invite people who need access
- Choose appropriate roles
- Consider privacy of team data

### Regular Cleanup

- Remove departed coaches promptly
- Review member list periodically
- Update roles as responsibilities change

### Communication

When inviting new members:

- Tell them to expect an email (or share the link directly)
- Explain their role and expectations
- Point them to relevant documentation

### Security Awareness

- Remove access quickly when someone leaves
- Use appropriate roles (don't over-permission)
- Monitor for unusual activity

## Handling Common Situations

### Coach Left Mid-Season

1. Remove their access immediately
2. Their tagging work is preserved
3. Reassign their responsibilities to other coaches

### New Assistant Coach Starting

1. Invite as Coach role
2. Provide onboarding information
3. Introduce them to existing workflows

### Volunteer Helping with Film

2. Explain tagging conventions
3. Assign specific games to tag

## Troubleshooting

### Invitation Not Received

1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Use **Resend** to send another email
4. Use **Copy Link** to share directly

### Can't Access After Accepting

1. Verify their status is "Active" in Members
2. Make sure they're logging in with the invited email
3. Have them try logging out and back in
4. Check if the correct team is selected

### Wrong Role Assigned

1. Go to Team Settings > Members
2. Click the role dropdown
3. Select the correct role
4. Changes take effect immediately

### Need to Re-Invite Someone

If someone was removed and needs access again:

1. Send a new invitation
2. Use the same or different email
3. They'll go through the acceptance flow again

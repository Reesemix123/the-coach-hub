### Setting Roles

When inviting, choose the appropriate role:

- **Viewer** - For read-only access (parents, players)

### Monitoring Activity

As owner, you can see:

- Who has access to your team
- When team members joined
- Film tagging attribution (who tagged what)

## Billing Responsibilities

### Subscription Management

The owner manages all billing:

- Current plan and features
- Payment method on file
- Monthly/annual billing cycle
- Plan upgrades and downgrades

### Accessing Billing

1. Go to **Console > Billing**
2. View your current subscription
3. Update payment methods
4. Change or cancel plans

### Usage Monitoring

Track your team's resource usage:

- Upload tokens used and remaining
- AI credits (if applicable)
- Storage consumption

## Team Settings

### Configuring Your Team

Access team settings to:

- Update team name
- Change team level (Little League, JV, Varsity, etc.)
- View team creation date
- See subscription status

### Privacy and Security

As owner, you're responsible for:

- Who has access to team data
- Removing departed coaches promptly
- Ensuring appropriate role assignments

## Best Practices

### Delegate Appropriately

You don't have to do everything yourself:

- Assign coordinators as Coaches
- Let volunteers tag film as Analysts
- Focus on administration and oversight

### Backup Access

Consider having a trusted assistant coach who could:

- Contact you if access issues arise
- Help manage day-to-day operations
- Take over if you're unavailable

### Regular Review

Periodically review your team:

- Remove access for departed coaches
- Update roles as responsibilities change
- Check billing and usage status

### Communication

Keep your team informed:

- Share playbook organization conventions
- Establish tagging standards
- Set expectations for access and usage

## Transferring Ownership

If you need to transfer team ownership:

1. Contact Youth Coach Hub support
2. Verify your identity
3. Specify the new owner's email
4. The new owner must accept the transfer

> **Note:** Transferring ownership also transfers billing responsibility.

## Common Questions

### Can I have multiple owners?

No, each team has one owner. However, you can give Coaches significant access—they just can't manage billing or team membership.

### What if I lose access?

Contact Youth Coach Hub support with your account email to recover access.

### Can I own multiple teams?

Yes, you can create and own multiple teams, each with its own subscription.

### How do I delete my team?

Go to **Console > Teams**, select the team, and find the delete option in settings. This is permanent and cannot be undone.

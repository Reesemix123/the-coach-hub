## Understanding the Limits

### Game Uploads

Each month you receive upload tokens:
- **Team games** - Film of your own team's games
- **Opponent games** - Film for scouting opponents

Tokens reset each billing cycle.

### Max Active Games

This represents how many games you can have accessible at once, based on your retention period:
- **Basic:** 2 games × 30 days = up to 2 active games
- **Plus:** 4 games/month × 6 months retention = ~24 active games
- **Premium:** 8 games/month × 12 months retention = ~96 active games

### Video Retention

How long your uploaded film remains accessible:
- After the retention period, videos are automatically removed
- **To keep film longer, upgrade your subscription**
- There is no way to extend retention without upgrading

### Storage Per Game

Each game has a storage limit for all camera angles combined:
- Basic: 5 GB total across all cameras
- Plus: 15 GB total across all cameras
- Premium: 25 GB total across all cameras

### Cameras Per Game

Multi-camera support varies by tier:
- **Basic:** Single camera angle only

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do all plans have the same features?

Yes. Every plan includes full access to all features: playbook, tagging, analytics, player stats, game planning, and more. The only differences are capacity limits.

### What happens when videos expire?

After your retention period (30/180/365 days), videos are automatically removed. Tagged play data is preserved, but video playback is no longer available.

### Can I extend retention for specific games?

The only way to extend retention is to upgrade your subscription. There are no per-game retention add-ons.

### Do unused uploads roll over?

No, monthly upload tokens reset each billing cycle.

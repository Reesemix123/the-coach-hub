## Overview

You can change your subscription plan at any time. Whether you need more features, additional uploads, or want to scale back, plan changes are simple and take effect immediately.

## Upgrading Your Plan

### When to Upgrade

Consider upgrading when you:

- Need more monthly game uploads
- Want multiple camera angles per game
- Need longer video retention (180 days or 1 year)
- Need more storage per game
- Have more coaches joining your staff

### How to Upgrade

1. Go to **Console > Billing**
2. Click **Change Plan** or **Upgrade**
3. Select your new plan
4. Review the pricing change
5. Confirm the upgrade

### What Happens When You Upgrade

**Immediate Effects:**

- Additional upload tokens are added
- Higher limits take effect immediately
- Storage extension applies to existing videos

**Billing:**
- You're charged the prorated difference
- Your next bill reflects the new plan price
- Billing cycle remains the same

### Prorated Billing Example

If you upgrade mid-cycle:

- **Current:** Plus plan ($29.99/month), 15 days into billing cycle
- **Upgrading to:** Premium plan ($79.99/month)
- **Charge:** ~$25 for remaining 15 days at Premium rate

## Downgrading Your Plan

### When to Downgrade

You might downgrade when:

- Season is over
- Budget constraints
- Fewer coaches on staff
- Don't need all features

### How to Downgrade

1. Go to **Console > Billing**
2. Click **Change Plan**
3. Select the lower plan
4. Review what you'll lose
5. Confirm the downgrade

### What Happens When You Downgrade

**At End of Billing Cycle:**

- You keep current limits until then
- No prorated refunds

**Capacity Changes:**
- Monthly upload tokens reduce
- Camera angles per game reduce
- Storage per game reduces
- Video retention period shortens
- Coach limits may be affected
- All features remain available (only capacity changes)

### Preserving Your Data

When you downgrade:

- Videos within storage limit are kept
- Videos beyond new limit may be archived
- Analytics data is preserved
- Playbook plays are kept

> **Warning:** If you have more coaches than your new plan allows, some may lose access.

## Switching Billing Cycles

### Monthly to Annual

Switch to annual billing to save 20%:

1. Go to **Console > Billing**
2. Select **Annual Billing**
3. Pay the annual rate
4. Enjoy the savings

**What Happens:**
- You're charged the full annual amount
- Any remaining monthly credit is applied
- New annual cycle begins

### Annual to Monthly

If you need to switch to monthly:

1. Wait until your annual term ends
2. Select monthly billing at renewal
3. Or contact support for mid-term options

> **Note:** Early termination of annual plans may not include refunds.

## Managing Upload Tokens

### Understanding Tokens

- Each plan includes monthly upload tokens
- 1 token = 1 game upload (any number of camera angles)
- Tokens reset at each billing cycle
- Unused tokens don't roll over

### Checking Your Token Balance

1. Go to **Team Settings > Usage**
2. View tokens used and remaining
3. See reset date

### Running Low on Tokens

If you're running out of tokens:

**Option 1: Wait for Reset**
- Tokens reset at your billing cycle
- Upload after the reset date

**Option 2: Upgrade Your Plan**
- Higher plans include more tokens
- Upgrade takes effect immediately

## Plan Change Scenarios

### Mid-Season Upgrade

Starting with Basic, season is busy:

1. Upload limit becomes a problem
2. Upgrade to Plus for more tokens
3. New tokens are added immediately
4. Continue uploading games

### Post-Season Downgrade

Season ends, want to save money:

1. Wait until billing cycle end
2. Downgrade to Basic
3. Keep access until next billing date
4. Lower rate applies at renewal

### Annual Plan Upgrade

On annual Basic, need Plus features:

1. Upgrade anytime
2. Pay prorated difference for remaining term
3. At renewal, pay annual Plus rate

## Canceling Your Subscription

### How to Cancel

1. Go to **Console > Billing**
2. Click **Cancel Subscription**
3. Confirm cancellation
4. Access continues until end of billing period

### What Happens After Cancellation

- Annual subscriptions end at end of current year
- After subscription ends, data is retained for 30 days (grace period)
- Videos and data may be deleted after the grace period

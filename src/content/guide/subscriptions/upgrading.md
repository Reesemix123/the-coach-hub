## Managing Upload Tokens

- Tokens reset at each billing cycle
- Unused tokens don't roll over

### Checking Your Token Balance

- Upload after the reset date

**Option 2: Purchase Additional Tokens**
- Buy extra tokens for the current month
- Available in the billing section
- Purchased tokens roll over for 30 days

**Option 3: Upgrade Your Plan**
- Higher plans include more tokens
- Upgrade takes effect immediately

## Failed Payments

### Why Payments Fail

Common reasons:

- Expired card
- Insufficient funds
- Card declined by bank
- Incorrect card details

### What Happens When Payment Fails

When a payment fails, here's the process:

1. **Immediate:** Stripe attempts to charge your card
2. **Day 1:** You receive an email notification about the failed payment
3. **Days 1-7:** A warning banner appears in the app showing days remaining
4. **During grace period:** Stripe makes multiple retry attempts automatically
5. **After 7 days:** If not resolved, account access is suspended

### In-App Warning Banner

When your payment fails, you'll see a warning banner at the top of the app:

- **Amber banner:** Shows during the 7-day grace period with countdown
- **Action button:** Click "Update Payment" to fix immediately
- **Dismissible:** You can dismiss the banner for 24 hours, but it will return

### Grace Period (7 Days)

After a payment fails, you have **7 days** to update your payment method:

- Full access continues during this period
- The warning banner shows how many days remain
- Stripe automatically retries payment during this time
- If payment succeeds (retry or updated card), the warning clears

### Account Suspension

If the grace period expires without successful payment:

- Access to team features is blocked
- You'll be redirected to a payment update page
- Your data is preserved and safe
- Access is restored immediately when payment succeeds

### Resolving Failed Payments

To restore access:

1. Go to **Team Settings > Subscription**
2. Click **Manage Payment Method**
3. Update your card in Stripe's secure portal
4. Payment will be retried automatically
5. Once successful, access is restored immediately

### Avoiding Payment Issues

To prevent failed payments:

- Keep your card details up to date
- Update expiring cards before they expire
- Ensure sufficient funds around billing dates
- Add a backup payment method in Stripe

## Refunds

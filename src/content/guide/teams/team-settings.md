Your new plan takes effect immediately, and tokens are prorated.

## Tips for Team Management

### Regular Check-ins

- Review your token usage mid-month to ensure you have enough uploads
- Check AI credits if you're using automated features

### Team Communication

- Share the Settings page with coaches so they understand their permissions
- Use the onboarding checklist to ensure new coaches are set up correctly

### Plan Appropriately

- If you consistently run out of tokens, consider upgrading
- Premium plan is best if you want AI-assisted tagging

## Troubleshooting

### Can't See Settings?

Only team owners and coaches can access settings. Viewers and analysts have limited access.

### Missing Features?

Some features are plan-specific:
- AI Credits tab only appears for Premium plans
- Token limits vary by plan

### Need to Add Coaches?

Adding coaches is done from the Console, not Settings:

1. Click your profile in the navigation
2. Select **Console**
3. Go to **People**
4. Click **Add Coach**

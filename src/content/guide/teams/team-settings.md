## Tips for Team Management

### Regular Check-ins

- Review token usage mid-month to ensure you have enough uploads
- Check pending invites to follow up with coaches who haven't accepted

### Token Management

- Tokens reset at the start of each billing period
- Subscription tokens are used first, then purchased tokens
- If you consistently run out, consider upgrading your plan

### Staff Communication

- Share the Settings page with coaches so they understand their permissions
- Use the Members tab to verify everyone has appropriate access

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't See Settings?

Only team owners and coaches can access settings. Some tabs (Subscription, Members) are owner-only.

### Can't Change Plan?

Only team owners can modify subscriptions. Contact your team owner for plan changes.

### Invited Coach Can't Access Team?

1. Check if their invitation is still "Pending"
2. Resend the invitation email
3. Verify they're logging in with the correct email address
4. Have them check spam/junk folders

### Running Low on Tokens?

- Wait for your billing cycle to reset
- Purchase additional tokens ($12 each, never expire)
- Upgrade to a higher plan for more monthly tokens

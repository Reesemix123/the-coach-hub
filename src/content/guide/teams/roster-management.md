## Overview

The Players page is where you manage your team's roster and depth chart. Having your roster set up enables you to track individual player performance when tagging film and generate player-specific analytics.

## Accessing the Roster

1. Navigate to your team dashboard
2. Click **Players** in the team navigation bar
3. You'll see your roster list and depth chart options

## View Modes

The Players page offers two viewing modes:

### Roster View

A complete list of all active players on your team. This view shows:

- Jersey number
- Player name
- Position(s)
- Grade level (if set)

Use the filter buttons to show:
- **All** - Every player
- **Offense** - Offensive players only
- **Defense** - Defensive players only
- **Special Teams** - Kickers, punters, returners

### Depth Chart View

Visual representation of your starting lineup and backups organized by position. Switch between:

- **Offense** - QB, RBs, WRs, TEs, offensive line
- **Defense** - DL, LBs, DBs
- **Special Teams** - K, P, LS, returners

## Managing the Depth Chart

### Setting Depth

When adding or editing a player, you can assign their depth at each position:

- **1st String** - Starter
- **2nd String** - Primary backup
- **3rd String** - Second backup

### Depth Chart Conflicts

If you try to assign two players to the same position and depth, you'll see a warning. Resolve conflicts by:

1. Changing the new player's depth
2. Updating the existing player's depth first
3. Removing the position from one player

### Best Practices

- Set starters (1st string) first for key positions
- Two-way players can have positions on both offense and defense
- Update depth chart after each week based on performance

## Editing Players

1. Find the player in the roster list
2. Click on their row or the edit button
3. Update any information
4. Click **Save**

## Removing Players

To remove a player from your active roster:

1. Find the player in the roster list
2. Click the edit button
3. Toggle **Active** to off (or click **Deactivate**)
4. The player will be removed from the active roster

> **Note:** Deactivated players are not deleted. Their historical data and stats are preserved.

## Why Roster Management Matters

### Film Tagging

When you tag plays with the Standard or Comprehensive tagging levels, you can attribute plays to specific players:

- Who carried the ball
- Who made the tackle
- Offensive line assignments
- Coverage players

### Analytics

With players set up, you unlock player-specific analytics:

- Individual rushing/receiving stats
- Tackle leaders
- Position group performance
- Player development tracking

### Depth Chart Reports

Generate reports showing:

- Starting lineup by position
- Backup depth
- Two-way player assignments

## Tips for Success

### Start with Starters

You don't need your entire roster immediately. Start with:

1. All starters (22 players minimum)
2. Key backups at skill positions
3. Add remaining players as needed

### Use Consistent Naming

- Enter names the same way every time
- Use proper capitalization
- Include jersey numbers for easy identification

### Keep It Updated

- Update the roster when players join or leave
- Adjust depth chart weekly based on performance
- Mark injured players in notes

### Grade Levels

Setting grade levels helps you:

- Track player development over seasons
- Plan for graduation/roster turnover
- Generate class-specific reports

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find a Player?

- Check if the filter is set to "All"
- The player may be deactivated - check inactive players
- Search by jersey number or name

### Depth Chart Not Showing Players?

- Make sure players have positions assigned
- Check that players have depth (1st, 2nd, 3rd string) set
- Verify you're viewing the correct unit (offense/defense/special teams)

### Position Not Available?

If you need a position that's not listed, use the closest equivalent and note the specific role in the player's notes field.

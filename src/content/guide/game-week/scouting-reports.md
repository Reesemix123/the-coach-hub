## Opponent Intelligence in Your Game Plan

When you build a game plan in The Coach Hub, opponent tendencies are automatically surfaced alongside your playbook. Every play you've tagged as an "opponent play" contributes to a profile of what you'll face on game day.

## Where to Find It

Opponent analysis appears directly in the **Game Plan** builder:

1. Navigate to **Game Week** from your team dashboard
2. Click the **Game Plan** tile (or "Build Game Plan")
3. Select the upcoming game you're preparing for
4. Opponent tendencies display in the sidebar as you browse plays

## What You'll See

### Defensive Tendencies

When planning your offense, you'll see the opponent's defensive profile:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Overall Blitz Rate** | How often they bring extra rushers |
| **Run Stop Rate** | Their success defending the run |
| **Pass Defense Rate** | Their effectiveness in coverage |
| **Primary Coverage** | The coverage they use most |
| **Coverage Distribution** | Breakdown of all coverages used |
| **High Blitz Situations** | Specific downs where they blitz heavily |

### Offensive Tendencies

When planning your defense, you'll see:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Run/Pass Ratio** | Their tendency to run vs. pass |
| **Yards Per Play** | Overall offensive efficiency |
| **Play Type by Down** | What they call on 1st, 2nd, 3rd down |
| **Formation Tendencies** | Their most common offensive looks |

### Special Teams Tendencies

If you've tagged special teams plays:

- Kickoff coverage patterns
- Punt tendencies
- Return schemes

## Confidence Indicators

The analysis shows confidence levels based on sample size:

| Sample Size | Confidence |
|-------------|------------|
| 60+ plays | High - strong patterns |
| 30-59 plays | Medium - reasonable trends |
| Under 30 | Low - use with caution |

## Recommendations

Based on the data, the system provides tailored recommendations:

- **High blitz rate?** "Use quick passes and screens"
- **Weak run defense?** "Establish the run early"
- **Cover 3 heavy?** "Target the seams and deep posts"
- **Aggressive vs. run?** "Mix in play-action and misdirection"

## Building Better Opponent Data

The more opponent film you tag, the better your insights:

- **Tag opponent plays** - Check "Opponent Play" when tagging their film
- **Include coverage** - Note what coverage they're running
- **Track formations** - Record their defensive/offensive formations
- **Multiple games** - Tag film from several games for trends

### How to Tag Opponent Plays

1. Go to **Film** and select a game against this opponent
2. When tagging plays, check **"Opponent Play"**
3. Fill in formation, coverage, and result
4. The data automatically flows to your Game Plan

> **Pro Tip:** Tag opponent film immediately after games while it's fresh. The data you collect throughout the season makes your playoff game plans significantly stronger.

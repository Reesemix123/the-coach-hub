## Understanding Your Opponent

Scouting reports transform tagged opponent film into actionable intelligence. Every play you've tagged about your opponent contributes to a clearer picture of what you'll face on game day.

## Generating a Scouting Report

### Prerequisites

To generate a meaningful scouting report, you need:

- At least one game with opponent plays tagged
- Basic tagging data (formation, play type, result)
- Ideally 20+ plays for statistical significance

### Creating the Report

1. Navigate to **Game Week** from your team dashboard
2. Select **Scouting Reports**
3. Choose the opponent you're preparing for
4. Select which games to include in the analysis
5. Click **Generate Report**

## What the Report Shows

### Defensive Tendencies

If you're scouting their defense:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Base Formation % | What defense do they line up in most? |
| Coverage Distribution | Man vs Zone breakdown |
| Blitz Rate by Down | When do they bring pressure? |
| Tendencies by Hash | Do they favor certain looks by field position? |

### Offensive Tendencies

If you're scouting their offense:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Run/Pass Ratio | Are they run-heavy or pass-happy? |
| Personnel Groupings | What formations do they favor? |
| Play Type by Down | What do they call on 1st down vs 3rd? |
| Key Players | Who gets the ball most often? |

### Situational Analysis

The report breaks down tendencies by situation:

- **Early Downs** (1st & 2nd) - What's their approach when ahead of schedule?
- **Third Down** - How do they convert? What do they call?
- **Red Zone** - How do they try to score?
- **Goal Line** - What's their go-to play?
- **Two-Minute** - How do they operate under time pressure?

## Using the Data

### Identify Exploitable Patterns

Look for:

- **Predictable tendencies** - Do they always run on 1st down?
- **Coverage tells** - Does their safety alignment give away the coverage?
- **Personnel-based patterns** - Do certain players only come in for certain plays?

### Prepare Counter-Strategies

For each tendency you identify:

1. Note the pattern
2. Select plays from your playbook that attack it
3. Practice recognition and execution

### Create Game Day Notes

Export key insights to a condensed format you can reference during the game:

- Top 5 things to remember
- Adjustments by situation
- Key players to watch

## Building Better Reports Over Time

The more opponent film you tag, the better your scouting reports become:

- **Multiple games** reveal consistent tendencies vs. one-game anomalies
- **Detailed tagging** (Standard or Comprehensive) provides richer analysis
- **Personnel tracking** shows substitution patterns

> **Pro Tip:** Tag opponent film immediately after games while it's fresh. The data you collect throughout the season makes your playoff scouting reports invaluable.

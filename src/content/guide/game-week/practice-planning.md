## Overview

Practice time is limited. Use your analytics to identify exactly what your team needs to work on based on real performance data.

> **Looking for how to build practices in the app?** See [Creating Practice Plans](/guide/practice/creating-practice-plans) for step-by-step instructions on building and managing practice plans.

## Identifying Practice Priorities

### What to Work On

Your analytics reveal areas that need attention:

**Offensive Priorities:**
- Plays with low success rates that you want to keep calling
- Situations where you struggle (3rd down, red zone, goal line)
- Formations where your execution is inconsistent

**Defensive Priorities:**
- Coverages that opponents are attacking successfully
- Situations where you're giving up big plays
- Alignment or assignment issues showing up in film

### What's Working

Don't forget to reinforce success:

- High-success plays that deserve more reps
- Formations where your team executes consistently
- Situations where you're performing well

## Building Practice Scripts

### Offensive Scripts

Create practice scripts based on:

1. **Tendency Data** - What does the opponent usually show?
2. **Your Best Plays** - What should you call against those looks?
3. **Situation Focus** - What game situations need work?

**Example Script Building:**

| Situation | Opponent Tendency | Your Play Call |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1st & 10 | Base 4-3, Cover 2 | Inside Zone, Play Action |
| 3rd & 5-7 | Nickel, Cover 3 | Slant-Flat, Mesh |
| Red Zone | Goal Line, Man | Sprint Out, Fade |

### Defensive Scripts

For your scout team offense:

1. Review opponent's most common plays
2. Build a card system based on their tendencies
3. Have scout team run realistic looks

## Practice Period Structure

### Individual Periods

Focus on technique work informed by film review:

- Position-specific corrections from game film
- Skill development for weaknesses identified in analytics
- Repetition of fundamentals that lead to success

### Team Periods

Structure team reps around game-like situations:

**Situational Practice Ideas:**

| Period | Focus | Data Source |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 3rd Down | Converting/Stopping | 3rd down success rates |
| Red Zone | Scoring/Defending | Red zone efficiency |
| 2-Minute | Clock management | Drive analytics |
| Goal Line | Short yardage | Goal-to-go conversion |

### Scrimmage Periods

Create game-realistic scenarios:

- Start at specific down/distance/field position
- Use opponent tendencies for defensive looks
- Track success just like a game

## Tracking Practice to Game Correlation

Over time, you can see if practice is translating:

- Are plays you rep heavily performing better?
- Are situations you focus on improving?
- Is there carryover from practice to games?

## Weekly Practice Flow

Use your analytics to structure each day's focus:

| Day | Focus | Data Source |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Monday** | Film review, corrections | Previous game analytics |
| **Tuesday** | Priority situations | Success rate by situation |
| **Wednesday** | Team execution | Game plan plays, opponent tendencies |
| **Thursday** | Fine-tuning | Remaining weak spots |
| **Friday** | Mental reps | Walk through key plays |

> **Tip:** Use [practice templates](/guide/practice/templates) to save your weekly structure and customize each week based on what your data tells you.

> **Remember:** The goal isn't to practice everything - it's to practice the right things. Your analytics tell you what matters most.

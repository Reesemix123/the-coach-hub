## Overview

Found something that isn't working right? Bug reports help us identify and fix issues quickly. The more detail you provide, the faster we can resolve the problem.

## What Is a Bug?

A bug is when the app doesn't work as expected:

- **Errors** - Error messages or crashes
- **Broken Features** - Something that worked before but doesn't now
- **Incorrect Behavior** - Feature works but gives wrong results
- **Display Issues** - Layout problems, missing content
- **Performance Issues** - Slow loading, freezing

### Not a Bug

These are better submitted as feedback:

- Feature you wish existed (feature request)
- Confusing interface (improvement suggestion)
- Question about how to use something (question)

## How to Report a Bug

### Step 1: Access Bug Report

1. Click the **Feedback** button in the navigation
2. Select **Report a Bug** as the type
3. Fill out the bug report form

### Step 2: Describe the Problem

Write a clear summary:

**Good Example:**
> "Videos won't play in the film viewer. When I click play, nothing happens and the video stays frozen on the first frame."

**Less Helpful:**
> "Video broken"

### Step 3: Include Details

Provide as much context as possible:

- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Any error messages (exact text)
- When it started happening

## What to Include in a Bug Report

### Required Information

| Detail | Why It Helps |
|--------|--------------|
| Description | What went wrong |
| Steps to reproduce | How we can see the bug ourselves |
| Expected behavior | What should have happened |
| Actual behavior | What actually happened |

### Helpful Additions

| Detail | Why It Helps |
|--------|--------------|
| Screenshots | Visual proof of the issue |
| Error messages | Exact error text |
| Browser/device | Environment information |
| When it started | Timeline of the issue |
| Workarounds | What you tried |

## Steps to Reproduce

### Why This Matters

If we can reproduce the bug, we can fix it. If we can't reproduce it, it's much harder.

### How to Write Good Steps

Number each action:

> 1. Go to Film page
> 2. Select a game with 2 camera angles
> 3. Click Camera 2 to switch views
> 4. Click the play button
> 5. **Bug:** Video doesn't play, shows spinning loader forever

### Be Specific

- Include exact clicks and actions
- Note any specific data (which game, which play)
- Mention if it happens every time or sometimes

## Screenshots and Recordings

### Taking Screenshots

Screenshots help show exactly what you see:

**On Mac:** Cmd + Shift + 4
**On Windows:** Win + Shift + S
**On iPhone:** Side button + Volume up
**On Android:** Power + Volume down

### What to Capture

- Error messages (the full message)
- The broken interface
- Before/after if relevant
- The URL in your browser

### Screen Recordings

For complex bugs, a video helps:

- Show the steps leading to the bug
- Capture timing issues
- Demonstrate intermittent problems

**Tools:**
- Mac: Cmd + Shift + 5
- Windows: Win + G (Game Bar)
- Browser: Various extensions

## Bug Report FAQ

### What if I can't reproduce it?

Report it anyway. Include:
- When it happened
- What you were doing
- That it only happened once (so far)

### Should I report the same bug twice?

If you have new information, yes. Reference your previous report.

### What if it fixes itself?

Still report it. Intermittent bugs are real bugs and need investigation.

### Will I know when it's fixed?

For significant bugs, we'll notify you. Check release notes for all fixes.

### Can I suggest the fix?

If you have technical insight, include it. We appreciate developer input.

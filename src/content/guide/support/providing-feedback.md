## Overview

Your feedback shapes the future of Youth Coach Hub. We actively listen to coaches and use your input to prioritize new features, improvements, and fixes.

## Ways to Provide Feedback

### In-App Feedback Button

The easiest way to send feedback:

1. Look for the **Feedback** button in the navigation
2. Click to open the feedback form
3. Select a feedback type
4. Write your message
5. Submit

### Feedback Types

When submitting feedback, categorize it:

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| **Feature Request** | New features you'd like to see |
| **Improvement** | Ways to make existing features better |
| **Question** | General questions about the platform |
| **Praise** | Let us know what's working well |

## Submitting Feature Requests

### What Makes a Good Feature Request

Help us understand your needs:

**Include:**
- What you're trying to accomplish
- Why current features don't solve it
- How you envision the solution
- How often you'd use it

**Example - Good Request:**
> "I'd love to be able to filter plays by game situation (red zone, 3rd down, etc.) when selecting plays to tag. Currently I have to scroll through all plays. This would save time during busy game weeks."

**Example - Less Helpful:**
> "Add more filters."

### Feature Request Process

1. **Submit** - Your request is logged
2. **Review** - We evaluate the request
3. **Prioritize** - Based on demand and feasibility
4. **Build** - If approved, added to roadmap
5. **Release** - You're notified when it ships

### Checking Request Status

Currently, feature requests are reviewed internally. Major releases include notes on what's new. We're working on a public roadmap.

## Suggesting Improvements

### Types of Improvements

- **Usability** - Making features easier to use
- **Performance** - Faster loading, smoother experience
- **Design** - Better layouts, clearer interfaces
- **Workflow** - Streamlined processes

### How to Describe Improvements

Be specific about the current experience:

> "When tagging plays, I have to click 6 times to save. It would be faster if there was a 'Save & Next' button to immediately move to the next play."

### Screenshots Help

If you're describing a UI improvement:

- Take a screenshot of the current state
- Describe what you'd change
- Mock it up if you can (optional)

## Asking Questions

### Before Asking

1. Check this documentation
2. Look for tooltips in the app
3. Review the FAQ section

### Asking Good Questions

Include context:

- What you're trying to do
- What you've already tried
- What happened vs. what you expected

**Example:**
> "I'm trying to upload a game video from my iPhone. When I select the file, nothing happens. I expected to see an upload progress bar. I'm using Safari on iOS 17."

### Question Response

Questions submitted via feedback are answered:

- By email to your account address
- Based on your plan's response time
- With helpful resources when applicable

## Providing Praise

### Why Praise Matters

Positive feedback helps us:

- Know what's working well
- Avoid changing things you love
- Motivate the team

### What to Share

- Features that save you time
- Moments when the app impressed you
- Things that "just work"
- Comparisons to previous tools

**Example:**
> "The play builder is incredibly intuitive. I was able to digitize our entire playbook in one afternoon. Much better than drawing plays by hand!"

## Feedback Best Practices

### Be Specific

Vague feedback is harder to act on:

- ❌ "The app is slow"
- ✅ "Video playback stutters when I have 3+ camera angles"

### One Topic Per Submission

Multiple issues in one message get confused:

- Submit separate feedback for separate topics
- Each gets proper tracking and attention

### Include Context

Help us reproduce your experience:

- What device/browser you're using
- What you were doing when it happened
- Any error messages you saw

### Be Constructive

We value all perspectives:

- Focus on the problem and potential solutions
- Assume we want to help
- Frustration is understandable, but specifics help more

## Writing Effective Feedback

### Be Specific

Vague feedback is harder to act on:

- **Less helpful:** "The app is slow"
- **More helpful:** "Video playback stutters when I have 3+ camera angles"

### Include Context

Help us understand your situation:

- What you were trying to accomplish
- What happened vs. what you expected
- What device/browser you're using
- Any error messages you saw

### One Topic Per Submission

Submit separate feedback for separate topics. This helps us:

- Track each issue properly
- Respond more effectively
- Measure progress accurately

### Good Feedback Examples

**Bug report:**
> "When I click 'Save Play' after drawing routes, the page refreshes and loses my changes. This happens in Chrome on macOS. I've tried three times."

**Feature request:**
> "I'd like to filter plays by game situation (red zone, 3rd down) when selecting plays to tag. Currently I scroll through all plays, which takes time during busy game weeks."

**Positive feedback:**
> "The play builder is incredibly intuitive. I was able to digitize our entire playbook in one afternoon!"

## Overview

Team Analytics provides a high-level view of your team's performance across all tagged games. Use these insights to evaluate your scheme, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make informed game planning decisions.

## Accessing Team Analytics

1. Navigate to your team dashboard
2. Click **Analytics** in the team navigation
3. Select the **Team** tab (default view)

## Key Metrics

### Success Rate

The percentage of plays that achieved their situational goal:

| Down | Success Threshold |
|------|-------------------|
| **1st Down** | Gain 40% of distance needed (e.g., 4+ yards on 1st & 10) |
| **2nd Down** | Gain 60% of remaining distance |
| **3rd/4th Down** | Convert for first down or score |

**Why It Matters:** Success rate is a better predictor of offensive efficiency than yards per play because it accounts for situational context.

### Yards Per Play (YPP)

Average yards gained per offensive snap:

- **Elite:** 6.0+ YPP
- **Good:** 5.0-5.9 YPP
- **Average:** 4.0-4.9 YPP
- **Below Average:** Under 4.0 YPP

### Explosive Play Rate

Percentage of plays that gain significant yardage:

- **Explosive Run:** 10+ yards
- **Explosive Pass:** 15+ yards

High explosive rates often correlate with scoring success.

### Points Per Drive

Average points scored per offensive possession:

- Includes touchdowns (6-7 pts), field goals (3 pts), and failed drives (0 pts)
- Better indicator than total points because it's adjusted for opportunities

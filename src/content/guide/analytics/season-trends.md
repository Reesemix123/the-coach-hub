## Overview

Season Trends helps you see the big picture of your team's development. Track how performance evolves game-by-game, identify improvement areas, and spot patterns that single-game analytics might miss.

## Accessing Season Trends

1. Navigate to your team dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Not Enough Data

Trends need multiple games:

- Minimum 3-4 games for meaningful trends
- More games = more reliable trends
- Be patient early in season

### Inconsistent Trends

If data seems unreliable:

- Check tagging consistency
- Verify play count accuracy
- Consider opponent context

### Missing Visualizations

If charts aren't appearing:

- Ensure games are tagged
- Check date range filter
- Verify data exists for the period

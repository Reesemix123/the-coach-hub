## Data Requirements

Analytics quality depends on your tagged film:

- **More tags = better data** - Tag all plays for complete analysis
- **Player attribution** - Assign players to plays for individual stats
- **Accurate details** - Correct yardage and results improve insights

## Understanding Key Metrics

These metrics appear across multiple reports:

### Success Rate

The percentage of plays that achieved their situational goal:

| Down | Success Threshold |
|------|-------------------|
| 1st Down | Gain 40% of distance needed (e.g., 4+ yards on 1st & 10) |
| 2nd Down | Gain 60% of remaining distance |
| 3rd/4th Down | Convert for first down or score |

**Why it matters:** Success rate predicts offensive efficiency better than raw yardage because it accounts for situational context.

### Yards Per Play (YPP)

Average yards gained per snap:

| Rating | YPP |
|--------|-----|
| Elite | 6.0+ |
| Good | 5.0-5.9 |
| Average | 4.0-4.9 |
| Below Average | Under 4.0 |

### Explosive Plays

Plays that gain significant yardage:

- **Explosive Run:** 10+ yards
- **Explosive Pass:** 15+ yards

High explosive play rates correlate with scoring success.

### Points Per Drive

Average points scored per offensive possession. Better than total points because it adjusts for number of opportunities.

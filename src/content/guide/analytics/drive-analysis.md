## Using the Report

### Evaluate Offensive Efficiency

Ask questions like:

- How often do we score when we get the ball?
- How many plays does it take us to score?
- What percentage of drives stall?

### Identify Drive Killers

Look for patterns in failed drives:

- What causes 3-and-outs?
- When do turnovers happen?
- What situations end drives?

### Improve Sustainment

Focus on extending drives:

- First down rate
- Third down conversion
- Red zone finishing

### Game Planning

Use drive data for:

- Scripting opening drives
- Managing clock in late-game situations
- Setting possession goals

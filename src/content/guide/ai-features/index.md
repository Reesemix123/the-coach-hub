## What It Does

The AI coaching assistant lets you ask questions about your team's performance in plain English. Instead of digging through reports, just ask things like:

- "How is my run game?"
- "Who's my leading tackler?"
- "What's our field goal percentage?"

The AI analyzes your tagged film data and gives you instant answers.

## Example Questions

Here are some questions coaches commonly ask:

| What You Want to Know | Ask This |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Overall run effectiveness | "How is my run game?" |
| Best blocker | "Who's my best offensive lineman?" |
| Top defender | "Who's my leading tackler?" |
| Kicking stats | "How is my kicker doing?" |
| Return game | "Who's my best return man?" |
| Situational | "How are we on third down?" |
| Specific player | "How is #22 doing?" |

## Tips

**Be specific** - "How is #22 at running back?" works better than "How are my players?"

**Ask follow-ups** - Start with "How is my defense?" then ask "Who's getting the most sacks?"

**Use situations** - Add context like "in the red zone" or "on third down"

## Need More Data?

The AI works best when you:

- Tag all your plays (not just some)
- Assign players to plays (ball carrier, tackler, etc.)
- Include accurate yardage

More tagged plays = better insights.

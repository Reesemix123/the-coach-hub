## Overview

Youth Coach Hub allows you to invite other coaches to collaborate on your team. You can invite anyone by email - even if they don't have an account yet. Each team member can have different access levels based on their role, making it easy to delegate film review and analysis tasks.

## Who Can Invite Coaches?

Only the **team owner** (the person who created the team) can invite new coaches. If you're not the team owner, contact them to request an invitation.

## Available Roles

When inviting a coach, you'll assign them one of these roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access including team settings, billing, and member management |
| **Coach** | Tag plays, view analytics, manage roster, access playbook |

## How to Invite a Coach

### Step 1: Open Team Settings

1. Navigate to your team dashboard
2. Click **Settings** in the team navigation
3. Select the **Members** tab

### Step 2: Start the Invitation

1. Click the **Invite Coach** button
2. Enter the coach's email address
3. Select their role (Coach or Owner)
4. Click **Send Invite**

### Step 3: Invitation is Sent

The invited coach will receive an email containing:

- Your team name
- Their assigned role
- A secure invitation link
- Instructions to get started

## What Happens Next?

### For New Users (No Account)

If the invited coach doesn't have a Youth Coach Hub account:

1. They click the invitation link in their email
2. They're taken to the signup page
3. They create an account using the signup form
4. After verifying their email, they're **automatically added to your team**

The invite link "remembers" them, so they don't need to do anything extra after signing up.

### For Existing Users

If the invited coach already has an account:

1. They click the invitation link in their email
2. They log in to their existing account (if not already logged in)
3. Your team is added to their team list
4. They can immediately access your team

## Managing Pending Invitations

Pending invitations are shown in the Members tab under a separate "Pending Invites" section.

### Available Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Copy Link** | Copy the invite URL to share directly (via text, chat, etc.) |
| **Resend** | Send another email invitation |
| **Cancel** | Revoke the invitation (link becomes invalid) |

### Sharing the Link Directly

If email isn't working well, you can:

1. Click **Copy Link** on the pending invite
2. Share the link directly via text message, Slack, etc.
3. The coach clicks the link and follows the same flow

### Invitation Expiration

Invitations expire after **7 days**. If an invitation expires:

1. The pending invite will still show in your list
2. Click **Resend** to send a fresh invitation
3. A new 7-day expiration period begins

## After a Coach Joins

Once a coach accepts their invitation:

- They appear in your Members list as "Active"
- They can immediately access all team features based on their role
- Their contributions (tagged plays, etc.) are tracked

## Best Practices

### Assign Roles Thoughtfully

- **Owner** role for head coaches who need full team control
- **Coach** role for assistant coaches who need access to film and playbook

### Communicate Expectations

When inviting new coaches, let them know:

- What you expect them to help with (tagging, analytics review, etc.)
- Any naming conventions or tagging standards you use
- How often you'd like them to review film

### Distribute the Workload

With multiple coaches, you can divide film review:

- Assign different games to different coaches
- Have one coach focus on offense, another on defense
- Use the "Tagged by" filter to see each coach's contributions

## Troubleshooting

### Invitation Not Received

If a coach says they didn't receive the invitation:

1. Check that you entered the correct email address
2. Ask them to check their spam/junk folder
3. Use **Resend** to send another email
4. Or use **Copy Link** to share directly

### Coach Can't Access the Team

If a coach created an account but can't see the team:

1. Verify their status is "Active" in the Members tab
2. Make sure they're logged in with the correct email
3. Have them refresh their browser or log out and back in

### Wrong Email Invited

If you invited the wrong email:

1. Find the pending invitation
2. Click **Cancel** to revoke it
3. Send a new invitation to the correct email

### Reached Coach Limit

Some plans have limits on the number of coaches:

| Plan | Coach Limit |
|------|-------------|
| Basic | 3 coaches |
| Plus | 10 coaches |
| Premium | Unlimited |

If you've reached your limit:

- Upgrade your plan for more coach seats (Team Settings > Subscription)
- Remove inactive coaches to free up space

## Next Steps

Once your coaches are set up:

- [Upload game film](/guide/film/uploading-film) for your team to review
- [Learn about tagging plays](/guide/film/tagging-plays) so everyone uses consistent methods
- [Review team settings](/guide/teams/team-settings) to understand all management options

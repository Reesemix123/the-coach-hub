## Overview

Youth Coach Hub allows you to invite other coaches to collaborate on your team. Each team member can have different access levels based on their role, making it easy to delegate film review and analysis tasks.

## Who Can Invite Coaches?

Only the **team owner** (the person who created the team) can invite new coaches. If you're not the team owner, contact them to request an invitation.

## Available Roles

When inviting a coach, you'll assign them one of these roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Coach** | Tag plays, view analytics, manage roster, access playbook |
| **Analyst** | Tag plays, view analytics, access playbook (cannot manage roster) |
| **Viewer** | View-only access to film, analytics, and playbook |

## How to Invite a Coach

### Step 1: Open the Console

1. Click on your profile or organization name in the navigation
2. Select **Console** from the dropdown menu
3. This opens your organization management dashboard

### Step 2: Navigate to People

1. In the Console navigation, click **People**
2. You'll see a list of all current team members

### Step 3: Add a New Coach

1. Click the **Add Coach** or **Invite** button
2. Enter the coach's email address
3. Select their role (Coach, Analyst, or Viewer)
4. Click **Send Invitation**

### Step 4: Coach Receives Invitation

The invited coach will receive an email with:

- An invitation to join your team
- A link to create their account (if they're new to Youth Coach Hub)
- Instructions to get started

## What Happens Next?

### For New Users

If the invited coach doesn't have a Youth Coach Hub account:

1. They click the invitation link in their email
2. They create an account using the signup form
3. After verifying their email, they're automatically added to your team

### For Existing Users

If the invited coach already has an account:

1. They click the invitation link
2. They log in to their existing account
3. Your team is added to their team list

## Managing Team Members

### View Team Members

From the Console > People page, you can see:

- All current team members
- Their assigned roles
- Their status (Active, Pending, or Deactivated)
- When they joined the team

### Resend an Invitation

If a coach didn't receive their invitation:

1. Find them in the People list (they'll show as "Pending")
2. Click the **More** menu (three dots)
3. Select **Resend Invitation**

### Change a Coach's Role

To update a team member's permissions:

1. Find them in the People list
2. Click the **More** menu
3. Select **Change Role**
4. Choose the new role

### Remove a Coach

If you need to remove someone from your team:

1. Find them in the People list
2. Click the **More** menu
3. Select **Deactivate**

Deactivated members can no longer access the team but their tagging contributions are preserved.

## Best Practices

### Assign Roles Thoughtfully

- **Coach** role is best for assistant coaches who need full access
- **Analyst** role works well for volunteers who help with film review
- **Viewer** role is useful for parents or players who want to see analytics

### Communicate Expectations

When inviting new coaches, let them know:

- What you expect them to help with (tagging, analytics review, etc.)
- Any naming conventions or tagging standards you use
- How often you'd like them to review film

### Distribute the Workload

With multiple coaches, you can divide film review:

- Assign different games to different coaches
- Have one coach focus on offense, another on defense
- Use the "Tagged by" filter to see each coach's contributions

## Troubleshooting

### Invitation Not Received

If a coach says they didn't receive the invitation:

1. Check that you entered the correct email address
2. Ask them to check their spam/junk folder
3. Resend the invitation from the Console

### Coach Can't Access the Team

If a coach created an account but can't see the team:

1. Verify their status is "Active" in the People list
2. Make sure they're logged in with the correct email
3. Have them refresh their browser or log out and back in

### Reached Coach Limit

Some plans have limits on the number of coaches:

- Check your plan's coach limit in Console > Billing
- Upgrade your plan or purchase additional coach seats if needed

## Next Steps

Once your coaches are set up:

- [Upload game film](/guide/film/uploading-film) for your team to review
- [Learn about tagging plays](/guide/film/tagging-plays) so everyone uses consistent methods
- Review analytics together to improve your game planning

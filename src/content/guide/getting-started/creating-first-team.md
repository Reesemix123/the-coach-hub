## Overview

Creating a team is the first step to unlocking all of Youth Coach Hub's features. Once your team is set up, you can invite coaches, build your playbook, upload game film, and track analytics.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Navigate to Team Setup

From the homepage, click **Get Started** or navigate to **Setup** from the main menu. This will take you to the team creation page.

### 2. Enter Team Details

Fill in the following information:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Team Name | Your team's name (e.g., "Westside Tigers") |
| Level | Select the appropriate level (Little League, Middle School, JV, Varsity) |
| Primary Color | Choose your team's main color |
| Secondary Color | Choose an accent color |

### 3. Save Your Team

Click **Create Team** to save your new team. You'll be redirected to your team dashboard where you can start adding more details.

## What's Next?

After creating your team, you can:

- **Add Players** - Build your roster with player names, positions, and jersey numbers
- **Invite Coaches** - Add assistant coaches and give them appropriate access levels
- **Create Your Playbook** - Start building plays or import from an existing playbook
- **Upload Game Film** - Add video from your games for analysis

> **Tip:** Start by adding your roster. Having players set up makes it easier to track individual performance when you start tagging film.

## Managing Multiple Teams

You can manage multiple teams from the same account. Each team has its own:

- Roster
- Playbook
- Game schedule
- Film library
- Analytics

Switch between teams using the team selector in the navigation bar.

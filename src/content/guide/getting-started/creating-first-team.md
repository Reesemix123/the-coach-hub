## Overview

Creating a team is the first step to unlocking all of Youth Coach Hub's features. Once your team is set up, you can add players, invite coaches, build your playbook, upload game film, and track analytics.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. Created your Youth Coach Hub account ([see Creating Your Account](/guide/getting-started/creating-account))
2. Selected a subscription plan (Basic, Plus, or Premium)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Navigate to Team Setup

After signing up, you'll be automatically directed to the team setup page. If you're already logged in, you can access it by:

- Clicking **Setup** from the main menu
- Or clicking **Create New Team** from your dashboard

### 2. Select Your Plan

If you haven't already selected a plan, you'll see three options:

| Plan | Best For | Key Features |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Basic** | Getting started | 2 uploads/month, 1 camera, 30-day storage |
| **Plus** | Serious coaches | 4 uploads/month, 3 cameras, play tagging & stats |
| **Premium** | Complete toolkit | 8 uploads/month, 5 cameras, advanced analytics, AI features |

Click on the plan that fits your needs.

### 3. Enter Team Details

| Field | Description | Example |

### 4. Complete Checkout (Paid Plans)

For Plus and Premium plans:

1. Click **Continue to Checkout**
2. Enter your payment information in the secure Stripe checkout
3. Complete the purchase

For the Basic plan, you can start immediately without payment.

### 5. Access Your Team Dashboard

After creating your team, you'll be redirected to your team dashboard where you can:

- View your team's home page
- Access the playbook
- Upload game film
- See analytics (once you start tagging plays)

## What's Next?

After creating your team, we recommend this order:

### 1. Add Your Roster

Build your roster with player information:

- Navigate to **Players** from your team dashboard
- Click **Add Player**
- Enter jersey numbers, names, and positions
- Having players set up makes it easier to track individual performance

### 2. Invite Coaches

Add assistant coaches to help with film review:

- See [Inviting Coaches](/guide/getting-started/inviting-coaches) for detailed instructions

### 3. Create Your Playbook

Start building your digital playbook:

- Navigate to **Playbook** from your team dashboard
- Click **New Play** to create your first play
- Use the play builder to draw formations and routes

### 4. Upload Game Film

Get your first game into the system:

- Navigate to **Film** from your team dashboard
- Create a new game
- Upload your video file
- See [Uploading Film](/guide/film/uploading-film) for detailed instructions

## Managing Multiple Teams

If you coach multiple teams:

- Each team requires its own subscription
- Switch between teams using the team selector in the navigation
- Each team has its own separate roster, playbook, and film library

## Team Settings

You can update your team settings at any time:

1. Navigate to your team dashboard
2. Click **Settings** in the navigation
3. Update team name, level, or colors
4. Manage subscription and billing

## Tips for Success

> **Start Small:** Upload one game and tag 10-15 plays to learn the system before diving into a full season of film.

> **Add Key Players First:** You don't need your full roster immediately. Start with your starters and add players as needed.

> **Name Games Clearly:** Use a consistent naming format like "vs [Opponent] - Week [#]" to keep your film library organized.

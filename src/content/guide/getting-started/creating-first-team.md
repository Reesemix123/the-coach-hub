## Overview

Creating a team is the first step to unlocking all of Youth Coach Hub's features. Once your team is set up, you can add players, invite coaches, build your playbook, upload game film, and track analytics.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. Created your Youth Coach Hub account ([see Creating Your Account](/guide/getting-started/creating-account))
2. Selected a subscription plan (Basic, Plus, or Premium)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Navigate to Team Setup

After signing up, you'll be automatically directed to the team setup page. If you're already logged in, you can access it by:

- Clicking **Setup** from the main menu
- Or clicking **Create New Team** from your dashboard

### 2. Select Your Plan

If you haven't already selected a plan, you'll see three options:

| Plan | Best For | Key Features |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Basic** | Getting started | 2 uploads/month, 1 camera, 30-day storage |
| **Plus** | Serious coaches | 4 uploads/month, 3 cameras, 90-day storage |
| **Premium** | Complete toolkit | 8 uploads/month, 5 cameras, 1-year storage |

Click on the plan that fits your needs.

### 3. Enter Team Details

Fill in the following information:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Team Name** | Your team's official name | "Westside Tigers" |
| **Level** | Select the appropriate level | Little League, Middle School, JV, Varsity |

### 4. Complete Checkout (Paid Plans)

For Plus and Premium plans:

1. Click **Continue to Checkout**
2. Enter your payment information in the secure Stripe checkout
3. Complete the purchase

For the Basic plan, you can start immediately without payment.

### 5. Access Your Team Dashboard

After creating your team, you'll be redirected to your team dashboard where you can:

- View your team's home page
- Access the playbook
- Upload game film
- See analytics (once you start tagging plays)

## What's Next?

Now that your team is set up:

- [Invite your coaching staff](/guide/getting-started/inviting-coaches)
- [Add players to your roster](/guide/teams/roster-management)
- [Upload your first game film](/guide/film/uploading-film)
- [Start building your playbook](/guide/playbook/creating-plays)

## Managing Multiple Teams

If you coach multiple teams:

- Each team requires its own subscription
- Switch between teams using the team selector in the navigation
- Each team has its own separate roster, playbook, and film library

## Team Settings

You can update your team settings at any time:

1. Navigate to your team dashboard
2. Click **Settings** in the navigation
3. Update team name, level, or colors
4. Manage subscription and billing

## Tips for Success

> **Start Small:** Upload one game and tag 10-15 plays to learn the system before diving into a full season of film.

> **Add Key Players First:** You don't need your full roster immediately. Start with your starters and add players as needed.

> **Name Games Clearly:** Use a consistent naming format like "vs [Opponent] - Week [#]" to keep your film library organized.

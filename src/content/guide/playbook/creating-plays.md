## Overview

Creating plays in Youth Coach Hub allows you to build a comprehensive digital playbook. Each play includes a visual diagram, formation details, and metadata that helps you organize and analyze your offense, defense, and special teams.

## Accessing the Playbook

1. Navigate to your team dashboard
2. Click **Playbook** in the team navigation bar
3. You'll see your existing plays or an empty state if you're just starting

## Creating a New Play

### Step 1: Start a New Play

1. Click the **New Play** button
2. You'll be taken to the Play Builder interface

### Step 2: Choose Play Type

Select the type of play you're creating:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Offense** | Offensive plays with routes, blocking schemes, and assignments |
| **Defense** | Defensive plays with coverage, gaps, and responsibilities |
| **Special Teams** | Kickoff, punt, field goal, and return plays |

### Step 3: Select a Formation

Choose from pre-built formations or create custom alignments:

**Offensive Formations:**
- Shotgun Spread
- Shotgun Trips
- I-Formation
- Singleback
- Pistol
- Wing-T
- And many more...

**Defensive Formations:**
- 4-3 Base
- 3-4 Base
- Nickel
- Dime
- Goal Line
- And more...

### Step 4: Name Your Play

Give your play a clear, descriptive name:

- **Good:** "Shotgun Trips Right - Mesh Concept"
- **Good:** "I-Right 36 Power"
- **Avoid:** "Play 1" or "New Play"

### Step 5: Set Play Attributes

Configure the play's metadata:

| Attribute | Options | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Play Type** | Run, Pass, RPO | Categorization and analytics |
| **Personnel** | 11, 12, 21, 22, etc. | Personnel grouping |
| **Formation** | Selected formation name | Organization |
| **Concept** | Specific play concept | Film tagging reference |

### Step 6: Build the Diagram

Use the Play Builder to create your visual diagram:

1. Position players on the field
2. Draw routes for receivers and backs
3. Assign blocking responsibilities to linemen
4. Add motion if applicable

See [Play Builder](/guide/playbook/play-builder) for detailed instructions.

### Step 7: Save the Play

1. Review your diagram and attributes
2. Click **Save Play**
3. Your play is added to the playbook

## Play Code System

Each play is assigned a unique play code automatically:

- Format: `P-001`, `P-002`, `P-003`, etc.
- Codes are sequential and unique
- Used for film tagging and analytics

You can also add your own play naming convention in the play name field.

## Play Components

### Diagram Elements

- **Players** - Circles representing each position
- **Routes** - Lines showing receiver paths
- **Blocking** - Arrows showing block assignments
- **Motion** - Dotted lines for pre-snap movement

### Metadata

- **Play Name** - Your naming convention
- **Play Code** - System-generated identifier
- **Formation** - Base formation used
- **Play Type** - Run, pass, or RPO
- **Personnel** - Player grouping (11, 12, etc.)
- **Tags** - Custom tags for organization

## Quick Tips

### Start Simple

When building your first plays:

1. Create 5-10 core run plays
2. Add 5-10 base pass concepts
3. Build from there as needed

### Use Consistent Naming

Develop a naming convention your staff understands:

- Include formation: "Gun Trips..."
- Include direction: "...Left"
- Include concept: "...Inside Zone"

### Add Context

Use the notes field to include:

- Coaching points
- When to call the play
- Key reads for the QB
- Blocking adjustments

### Link to Film

After tagging game film:

- Plays show success rate data
- See when each play works best
- Identify needed adjustments

## Duplicating Plays

To create variations of existing plays:

1. Open the play you want to copy
2. Click **Duplicate**
3. Modify the copy as needed
4. Save with a new name

This is useful for:

- Creating mirrored versions (left/right)
- Adding motion variations
- Building play-action off run plays

## Editing Plays

To modify an existing play:

1. Find the play in your playbook
2. Click to open it
3. Click **Edit**
4. Make your changes
5. Click **Save**

> **Note:** Editing a play updates it everywhere, including film tags that reference it.

## Deleting Plays

To remove a play:

1. Open the play
2. Click **Delete** or **Archive**
3. Confirm the action

> **Warning:** Deleted plays are permanently removed. Consider archiving instead if you might need it later.

## Best Practices

### Organize as You Go

- Tag plays with situations (Red Zone, 3rd Down, etc.)
- Group by formation family
- Mark plays as "installed" vs "future"

### Keep It Current

- Remove plays you no longer run
- Update diagrams after scheme changes
- Archive old plays instead of deleting

### Collaborate with Staff

- Assign coaches to create position-specific plays
- Use consistent terminology
- Review new plays as a staff

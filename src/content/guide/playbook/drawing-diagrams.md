## Overview

The Play Builder is Youth Coach Hub's visual tool for creating play diagrams. It provides a football field canvas where you can position players, draw routes, assign blocking schemes, and add pre-snap motion.

## The Play Builder Interface

### Field Canvas

The main area displays a football field with:

- Yard lines for reference
- Hash marks
- Line of scrimmage (LOS)
- Neutral zone indicator

### Player Icons

Each player appears as a circle on the field:

- **Offense** - Positioned at or behind the LOS
- **Defense** - Positioned in front of the LOS
- Labels show position (QB, RB, WR, etc.)

### Toolbar

Controls for building your play:

- Formation selector
- Play type (offense/defense)
- Route drawing tools
- Motion controls
- Save/cancel buttons

## Positioning Players

### Selecting a Formation

1. Choose a base formation from the dropdown
2. Players automatically position according to the formation
3. Fine-tune positions as needed

### Moving Players

1. Click and drag any player
2. Release to set their new position
3. The diagram updates in real-time

### Position Constraints

- Offensive players must be at or behind the LOS
- 7 players must be on the line of scrimmage
- Maximum 4 players in the backfield

The system validates formations and warns you of illegal alignments.

## Tips for Better Diagrams

### Keep It Clean

- Don't overcrowd the field
- Use consistent route depths
- Align players neatly

### Show Key Information

- Highlight primary receiver
- Show the ball carrier path
- Include blocking assignments

### Use Color Effectively

- Primary routes stand out
- Secondary options are subtle
- Blocking is distinct from routes

### Be Consistent

- Use same route types consistently
- Position formations the same way
- Follow your terminology

## Troubleshooting

### Players Won't Move

- Click directly on the player circle
- Drag to desired location
- Release to set position

### Routes Not Appearing

- Make sure player is selected
- Choose a route type
- Check that assignment saved

### Validation Errors

- Read the error message
- Adjust player positions
- Verify formation requirements

### Diagram Looks Wrong

- Reset to base formation
- Rebuild step by step
- Check for overlapping players

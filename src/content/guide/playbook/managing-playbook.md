## Overview

As your playbook grows, organization becomes essential. Youth Coach Hub provides multiple ways to categorize, filter, edit, and manage plays for easy access during game week preparation and in-game situations.

## Editing Plays

### Making Changes

To modify an existing play:

1. Find the play in your playbook
2. Click to open it
3. Click **Edit**
4. Make your changes
5. Click **Save**

> **Note:** Editing a play updates it everywhere, including film tags that reference it.

## Duplicating Plays

### Creating Variations

To create variations of existing plays:

1. Open the play you want to copy
2. Click **Duplicate**
3. **Rename the play** - The name will have "(Copy)" appended; update it to describe the variation (e.g., "22 Power Left" to "22 Power Right")
4. Modify the diagram or attributes as needed
5. Click **Save Play**

### When to Duplicate

This is useful for:

- Creating mirrored versions (left/right)
- Adding motion variations
- Building play-action off run plays
- Creating situational variations (red zone, goal line)

> **Note:** The duplicate gets a new play code automatically. All film tags stay with the original play.

## Deleting Plays

### Removing a Play

To remove a play:

1. Open the play
2. Click **Delete** or **Archive**
3. Confirm the action

> **Warning:** Deleted plays are permanently removed. Consider archiving instead if you might need it later.

## Playbook Views

### List View

The default view shows all plays in a list format:

- Play code and name
- Formation
- Play type (run/pass)
- Personnel grouping
- Quick preview thumbnail

### Grid View

A visual grid showing play diagram thumbnails:

- Easier to scan visually
- Good for play selection during games
- Shows key details at a glance

### Formation View

Groups plays by their base formation:

- See all Shotgun plays together
- View I-Formation packages
- Quickly find formation-specific options

## Filtering Plays

Use filters to narrow down your playbook:

### By Play Type

- **Offense** - All offensive plays
- **Defense** - All defensive plays
- **Special Teams** - Kicks, punts, returns

### By Category

- **Run** - Running plays
- **Pass** - Passing plays
- **RPO** - Run-pass options
- **Play Action** - Play-action passes

### By Formation

Filter to specific formations:

- Shotgun
- I-Formation
- Singleback
- Pistol
- And others...

### By Personnel

Filter by personnel grouping:

| Personnel | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **11** | 1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WR |
| **12** | 1 RB, 2 TE, 2 WR |
| **21** | 2 RB, 1 TE, 2 WR |
| **22** | 2 RB, 2 TE, 1 WR |
| **10** | 1 RB, 0 TE, 4 WR |

### By Tags

Filter by custom tags you've created:

- Red Zone
- 3rd & Short

## Tagging System

### Using Tags for Game Planning

## Archiving Plays

Archive plays that are:

- No longer in your active scheme

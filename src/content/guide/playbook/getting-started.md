## Overview

Creating plays in Youth Coach Hub allows you to build a comprehensive digital playbook. Each play includes a visual diagram, formation details, and metadata that helps you organize and analyze your offense, defense, and special teams.

## Accessing the Playbook

1. Navigate to your team dashboard
2. Click **Playbook** in the team navigation bar
3. You'll see your existing plays or an empty state if you're just starting

## Creating Your First Play

### Step 1: Start a New Play

1. Click the **New Play** button
2. You'll be taken to the Play Builder interface

### Step 2: Choose Play Type

Select the type of play you're creating:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Offense** | Offensive plays with routes, blocking schemes, and assignments |
| **Defense** | Defensive plays with coverage, gaps, and responsibilities |
| **Special Teams** | Kickoff, punt, field goal, and return plays |

### Step 3: Select a Formation

Choose from pre-built formations or create custom alignments:

**Offensive Formations:**
- Shotgun Spread
- Shotgun Trips
- I-Formation
- Singleback
- Pistol
- Wing-T
- And many more...

**Defensive Formations:**
- 4-3 Base
- 3-4 Base
- Nickel
- Dime
- Goal Line
- And more...

### Step 4: Name Your Play

Give your play a clear, descriptive name:

- **Good:** "Shotgun Trips Right - Mesh Concept"
- **Good:** "I-Right 36 Power"
- **Avoid:** "Play 1" or "New Play"

### Step 5: Set Play Attributes

Configure the play's metadata:

| Attribute | Options | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Play Type** | Run, Pass, RPO | Categorization and analytics |
| **Personnel** | 11, 12, 21, 22, etc. | Personnel grouping |
| **Formation** | Selected formation name | Organization |
| **Concept** | Specific play concept | Film tagging reference |

### Step 6: Build the Diagram

Use the Play Builder to create your visual diagram:

1. Position players on the field
2. Draw routes for receivers and backs
3. Assign blocking responsibilities to linemen
4. Add motion if applicable

See [Drawing Play Diagrams](/guide/playbook/drawing-diagrams) for detailed instructions on using the visual editor.

### Step 7: Save the Play

1. Review your diagram and attributes
2. Click **Save Play**
3. Your play is added to the playbook

## Play Code System

Each play is assigned a unique play code automatically:

- Format: `P-001`, `P-002`, `P-003`, etc.
- Codes are sequential and unique
- Used for film tagging and analytics
- **System-generated** - you cannot create custom codes

You can add your own naming convention in the play name field, which is fully editable.

### ODK (Offense/Defense/Kicking)

## Quick Tips

### Start Simple

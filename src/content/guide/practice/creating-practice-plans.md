## Accessing Practice Plans

1. Navigate to your team dashboard
2. Click **Practice** in the team navigation bar
3. You'll see your list of practice plans

### Practice List Views

Filter your practices by:

- **Upcoming** - Future practices on your schedule
- **Past** - Completed practices
- **Templates** - Saved practice templates for reuse
- **All** - Every practice plan

## Creating a New Practice Plan

### Start a New Plan

1. Click the **New Practice Plan** button
2. Fill in the practice details

### Practice Details

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Title** | Name your practice (e.g., "Monday Practice - Week 3") | Yes |
| **Date** | When the practice occurs | Yes |
| **Duration** | Total practice length in minutes | Yes |
| **Location** | Field or facility name | No |
| **Notes** | Overall practice focus or reminders | No |

## Building Your Practice Structure

### Understanding Periods

Periods are the building blocks of your practice. Each period represents a segment of practice time dedicated to a specific activity.

**Period Types:**

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Warmup** | Pre-practice preparation | Stretching, agility, dynamic warmup |
| **Drill** | Position-specific skill work | Routes, blocking, tackling |
| **Team** | Full team activities | Team run, 7-on-7, scrimmage |
| **Special Teams** | Kicking game work | Punt, kickoff, field goal |
| **Conditioning** | Physical conditioning | Sprints, gassers, endurance |
| **Other** | Anything else | Film review, walk-through, breaks |

### Adding Periods

1. In your practice plan, click **Add Period**
2. Enter the period details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | What this period covers (e.g., "Individual Drills") |
| **Duration** | Length in minutes |
| **Period Type** | Select from the types above |
| **Notes** | Specific instructions or focus areas |

3. Click **Save** to add the period

### Period Order

Periods appear in the order you add them. To reorder:

1. Drag periods to rearrange them
2. The timeline view updates automatically

### Concurrent Periods

Some practice periods happen simultaneously. For example, while QBs work on footwork, receivers run routes.

To mark periods as concurrent:

1. Enable the **Concurrent** toggle on a period
2. Concurrent periods display side-by-side in the timeline
3. Use this for position-specific work happening at the same time

## Adding Drills to Periods

### What Are Drills?

Drills are specific activities within a period. A "Drill" period might contain multiple individual drills for different position groups.

### Creating Drills

1. Select a period
2. Click **Add Drill**
3. Fill in drill details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Drill Name** | Name of the drill (e.g., "Cone Route Running") |
| **Position Group** | Which players participate |
| **Description** | How to run the drill |
| **Play Codes** | Plays from your playbook to practice |
| **Equipment** | Required equipment |

### Position Groups

Assign drills to specific position groups:

| Group | Positions |
|-------|-----------|
| **All** | Entire team |
| **QB** | Quarterbacks |
| **RB** | Running backs |
| **WR** | Wide receivers |
| **TE** | Tight ends |
| **OL** | Offensive line |
| **DL** | Defensive line |
| **LB** | Linebackers |
| **DB** | Defensive backs |

### Linking Playbook Plays

Connect drills to your playbook for focused reps:

1. In the drill form, find the **Play Codes** field
2. Search or select plays from your playbook
3. The drill now references specific plays to practice

This helps you:
- Track which plays you've repped in practice
- Ensure game plan plays get adequate practice time
- Connect practice work to game preparation

## Practice Timeline

### Viewing the Timeline

The practice timeline provides a visual overview of your practice structure:

- Periods appear as blocks on a timeline
- Duration is shown by block width
- Concurrent periods appear stacked
- Total practice time is calculated automatically

### Using the Timeline

The timeline helps you:

- See at a glance how practice time is allocated
- Identify gaps or overlaps
- Balance position-specific and team time
- Ensure adequate time for each focus area

## Saving Your Practice

### Save Options

When your practice plan is complete:

- **Save** - Saves the practice plan
- **Save & Add to Schedule** - Saves and creates a calendar event

### Editing Practices

To edit an existing practice:

1. Find the practice in your list
2. Click on it to view details
3. Click **Edit**
4. Make your changes
5. Click **Save**

## Practice Plan Actions

### Duplicate a Practice

Create a copy of an existing practice:

1. Open the practice you want to copy
2. Click **Duplicate**
3. Modify the title and date
4. Adjust periods as needed
5. Save the new practice

This is useful for:
- Weekly practice structures that repeat

1. Open the practice
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

> **Note:** This removes the practice plan but doesn't affect any scheduled events that were created from it.

## Sample Practice Structure

| Period | Type | Duration | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Dynamic Warmup | Warmup | 10 min | Full team |
| Individual Drills | Drill | 20 min | Position-specific (concurrent) |
| Inside Run | Team | 15 min | OL/RB vs DL/LB |
| 7-on-7 Passing | Team | 15 min | QB/WR/TE vs LB/DB |

## Tips for Effective Practice Plans

### Time Management

- Account for transition time between periods
- Build in water breaks during hot weather
- Leave buffer time for periods that may run long

### Position Group Balance

- Ensure all position groups get adequate individual time
- Use concurrent periods for efficient position work
- Balance offensive and defensive team periods

### Playbook Integration

- Link game plan plays to specific drill periods
- Track which plays need more practice reps
- Review play success rates to prioritize practice time

### Consistency

- Use similar practice structures week-to-week
- Players learn the routine and maximize time
- Templates help maintain consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Practice Not Appearing on Schedule?

- Use "Save & Add to Schedule" when creating
- Or manually add the practice to your schedule
- Check the date is correct

### Timeline Looks Wrong?

- Verify period durations add up correctly
- Check for overlapping concurrent periods
- Ensure period order is correct

### Can't Find a Practice?

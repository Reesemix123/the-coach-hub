## Overview

Practice templates let you save successful practice structures and reuse them throughout the season. Instead of building each practice from scratch, start with a template and customize as needed.

## Why Use Templates?

Templates help you:

- **Save time** - Don't rebuild the same structure every week
- **Maintain consistency** - Players learn the routine
- **Preserve what works** - Capture your best practice formats
- **Share structure** - Other coaches can use your templates

## Creating a Template

### From a New Practice

1. Create a practice plan with your desired structure
2. When saving, check **Save as Template**
3. Enter a template name (e.g., "Tuesday Practice Template")
4. The practice is saved and also added as a template

### From an Existing Practice

1. Open a practice that worked well
2. Click **Save as Template**
3. Enter a template name
4. The structure is saved for future use

## Managing Templates

### Viewing Templates

1. Go to **Practice** in your team dashboard
2. Click the **Templates** filter
3. You'll see all saved templates

### Template Information

Each template shows:

- Template name
- Total duration
- Number of periods
- When it was created

## Using a Template

### Start from Template

1. Click **New Practice Plan**
2. Select **Start from Template**
3. Choose your template
4. The practice structure is pre-populated

### Customize After Loading

Once a template loads:

1. Update the title and date
2. Adjust period durations as needed
3. Add or remove periods
4. Modify drills for this week's focus
5. Save as a regular practice plan

> **Note:** Changes to a practice created from a template don't affect the original template.

## Template Best Practices

### Create Day-Specific Templates

Build templates for each practice day:

| Template | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| **Monday Practice** | Install new plays, walk-throughs |
| **Tuesday Practice** | Heavy team periods, full contact |
| **Wednesday Practice** | Situational work, 3rd downs, red zone |
| **Thursday Practice** | Polish, special teams, light work |
| **Friday Walk-Through** | Mental reps, game prep |

### Include Standard Elements

Good templates include:

- Consistent warmup structure
- Position group drill time
- Team period progression
- Special teams allocation
- Conditioning

### Leave Room for Customization

Design templates that are:

- Structured enough to save time
- Flexible enough to adjust weekly
- Clear about what changes week-to-week

### Name Templates Clearly

Use descriptive names:

- "Full Pads Tuesday - 2hr"
- "Game Week Wednesday"
- "Helmets Only Thursday"
- "Pre-Game Friday Walk-Through"

4. Update the template with improvements

### Seasonal Adjustments

You might need different templates for:

- **Preseason** - Conditioning-heavy, fundamentals
- **Regular season** - Game plan focused
- **Playoffs** - Opponent-specific preparation

### Review and Improve

After each week:

- Did the template structure work?
- What would you change?
- Update templates to reflect learnings

## Troubleshooting

### Template Not Loading Correctly?

- You must be the template owner to edit
- Check your team role permissions

### Template Changes Not Saving?

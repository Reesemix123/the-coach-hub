## Overview

Youth Coach Hub's film system allows you to upload game footage, tag individual plays, and generate analytics. This guide covers how to get your video into the platform.

## Supported Formats

The platform supports most common video formats:

- MP4 (recommended)
- MOV
- AVI
- WebM

> **Tip:** MP4 files typically provide the best balance of quality and file size for web playback.

## Uploading Video

### 1. Create a Game Record

Before uploading film, you need a game to associate it with:

1. Go to your team's **Schedule** tab
2. Click **Add Game**
3. Enter the game details (opponent, date, location)
4. Save the game

### 2. Upload the Video

1. Navigate to the game you just created
2. Click **Upload Film** or drag and drop your video file
3. Wait for the upload to complete (this may take a few minutes for longer videos)

### 3. Video Processing

After upload, the video will be processed for web playback. You'll see a progress indicator. Once complete, you can:

- Play the video in the built-in player
- Start tagging plays
- Add notes and markers

## Organizing Your Film Library

### Multiple Videos Per Game

You can upload multiple videos for a single game. This is useful when you have:

- First half and second half as separate files
- Different camera angles
- Sideline and end zone footage

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent names for your videos:

- `vs-Eastside-Week3-Full.mp4`
- `vs-Eastside-Week3-Offense.mp4`
- `vs-Eastside-Week3-Defense.mp4`

## Storage Limits

Storage limits depend on your subscription plan:

| Plan | Team Storage | Per-Game Limit |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Basic | 10 GB | 5 GB |
| Plus | 50 GB | 15 GB |
| Premium | 200 GB | 25 GB |

When uploading, you'll see warnings if your file will bring you close to either your team or game storage limit. If you exceed the limit, you'll need to delete existing videos or upgrade your plan.

> **Note:** Older games can be archived to free up storage while preserving your play-by-play data and analytics.

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Stuck or Failed

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a smaller file (compress if needed)
3. Ensure the video format is supported
4. Clear your browser cache and try again

### Video Won't Play

1. Wait for processing to complete
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check if the video plays in another application (file may be corrupted)

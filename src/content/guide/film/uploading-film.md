## Overview

Youth Coach Hub's film system allows you to upload game footage, tag individual plays, and generate analytics. This guide covers how to get your video into the platform.

## Supported Formats

The platform supports most common video formats:

- MP4 (recommended)
- MOV
- AVI
- WebM

> **Tip:** MP4 files typically provide the best balance of quality and file size for web playback.

## Uploading Video

### 1. Create a Game Record

Before uploading film, you need a game to associate it with:

1. Go to your team's **Schedule** tab
2. Click **Add Game**
3. Enter the game details (opponent, date, location)
4. Save the game

### 2. Upload the Video

1. Navigate to the game you just created
2. Click **Upload Film** or drag and drop your video file
3. Wait for the upload to complete (this may take a few minutes for longer videos)

### 3. Video Processing

After upload, the video will be processed for web playback. You'll see a progress indicator. Once complete, you can:

- Play the video in the built-in player
- Start tagging plays
- Add notes and markers

## Organizing Your Film Library

### Multiple Videos Per Game

You can upload multiple videos for a single game. This is useful when you have:

- First half and second half as separate files
- Different camera angles
- Sideline and end zone footage

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent names for your videos:

- `vs-Eastside-Week3-Full.mp4`
- `vs-Eastside-Week3-Offense.mp4`
- `vs-Eastside-Week3-Defense.mp4`

## Storage Limits

Storage limits depend on your subscription tier:

| Tier | Storage |
|------|---------|
| Free | 5 GB |
| Pro | 50 GB |
| Team | 200 GB |

> **Note:** Older games can be archived to free up storage while preserving your play-by-play data and analytics.

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Stuck or Failed

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a smaller file (compress if needed)
3. Ensure the video format is supported
4. Clear your browser cache and try again

### Video Won't Play

1. Wait for processing to complete
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check if the video plays in another application (file may be corrupted)

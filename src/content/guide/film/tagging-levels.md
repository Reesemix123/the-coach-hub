order: 3
---

## Overview

Youth Coach Hub offers three tagging levels (Quick, Standard, and Comprehensive) that let you choose how much detail to capture when analyzing game film. Each level unlocks different analytics capabilities and requires different time investments.

## Choosing Your Tagging Level

When you start tagging a game, you'll select a tagging level. This choice affects:

- **Fields available** in the tagging form
- **Time required** per play
- **Analytics unlocked** from your data
- **Player evaluation depth**

> **Important:** You can upgrade to a higher tier later, but you cannot downgrade. Choose based on your current needs - you can always add more detail.

## Quick Reference

| Level | Time/Play | Best For | Key Analytics |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Quick** | 15-20 sec | Game record, season tracking | Win/loss, yards, turnovers |
| **Standard** | 30-45 sec | Game planning, scheme evaluation | Play effectiveness, tendencies |
| **Comprehensive** | 2-3 min | Player evaluation, development | Individual grades, position analysis |

## Choosing the Right Level

### Questions to Ask Yourself

| Question | If Yes... |
|----------|-----------|
| Do I just need to remember what happened? | Choose **Quick** |
| Do I need to know which plays work best? | Choose **Standard** |
| Do I need to grade individual players? | Choose **Comprehensive** |
| Am I short on time? | Choose **Quick** |
| Am I preparing for a specific opponent? | Choose **Standard** |
| Do I need to make lineup decisions? | Choose **Comprehensive** |

### By Coaching Level

**Youth/Little League:**
- **Quick** is usually sufficient
- Focus on participation and game records
- Comprehensive may be overkill

**Middle School:**
- **Standard** for most games
- Comprehensive for key games or player evaluation periods

**High School:**
- **Standard** as baseline
- **Comprehensive** for self-scouting and player development weeks

### By Time Available

| Available Time | Recommended Tier |
|----------------|------------------|
| 1 hour per game | Quick |
| 2-3 hours per game | Standard |
| 4+ hours per game | Comprehensive |

---

## Upgrading Tiers

### When to Upgrade

You might upgrade mid-game if you realize:

- You need more detail than originally planned
- A game is more important than expected
- You want player-level grades for a key matchup

### How to Upgrade

1. While tagging, click the tier badge in the tagging interface
2. Select the higher tier you want
3. Confirm the upgrade
4. New fields become available for remaining plays

### What Happens to Existing Tags

- **Already tagged plays** keep their existing data
- **New fields** will be empty on old plays
- You can go back and add the new data to important plays
- Analytics adjust to account for partial data

> **Note:** You cannot downgrade once you've selected a tier. If you start at Comprehensive, you'll see all fields for the entire game.

## Impact on Analytics

### Data Completeness

Your analytics are only as good as your data:

| Tier | Analytics Confidence |
|------|---------------------|
| Quick | Game-level stats accurate |
| Standard | Scheme-level analysis accurate |
| Comprehensive | Player-level grades accurate |

### Missing Data Handling

If you use Quick tier, analytics that require Standard data will:

- Show as "Not Available" or
- Be calculated with limited accuracy
- Display a note about incomplete data

### Consistency Matters

For meaningful season-long analytics:

- Tag all games at the same tier when possible
- Upgrade important games (playoffs, rivals)
- Keep opponent scouting at Standard minimum

---

## Best Practices

### Start Realistic

- Don't commit to Comprehensive if you won't finish
- A fully-tagged Quick game beats a half-tagged Comprehensive game
- You can always do more detail next time

### Prioritize Key Games

- Playoff games: Consider upgrading
- Rivalry games: Tag at your best tier
- Early season: Quick may be fine while building your system

### Balance Quantity vs Quality

| Goal | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Season overview | Quick tier, all games |
| Scheme refinement | Standard tier, most games |
| Player development | Comprehensive for 2-3 key games per month |

### Team Tagging

If multiple coaches tag:

- Agree on a tier before starting
- Use the same tier for the whole game
- Calibrate on grading criteria for Comprehensive

## Overview

Youth Coach Hub supports multiple camera angles for each game, allowing you to see plays from different perspectives. Upload footage from sideline cameras, end zone cameras, or any other angles you capture, then sync them together for seamless playback.

## Why Use Multiple Cameras?

Different angles reveal different details:

| Camera Position | Best For |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Sideline (Wide)** | Overall play development, routes, coverage |
| **End Zone** | Offensive/defensive line play, blocking schemes |
| **Tight Sideline** | Ball carrier, tackle points, individual players |
| **Press Box** | All-22 view, secondary coverage |

## Camera Limits by Plan

The number of cameras you can upload per game depends on your subscription:

| Plan | Camera Limit |
|------|--------------|
| Basic | 1 camera |
| Plus | 3 cameras |
| Premium | 5 cameras |

> **Tip:** You can upgrade your plan at any time to add more camera angles.

## Adding Camera Angles

### Uploading Your First Camera

1. Navigate to **Film** in your team dashboard
2. Select or create a game
3. Click **Upload Video** or drag a file into the upload area
4. This becomes your **Primary Camera**

### Adding Additional Cameras

1. In the film viewer, find the **Camera Angles** section
2. Click **Add Camera**
3. Select or drag your video file
4. The upload begins and shows progress
5. Once processed, the new camera appears in the row

### Camera Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Upload queued |
| **Processing** | Video being processed |
| **Ready** | Available for playback |
| **Failed** | Upload error - retry needed |

---

## Understanding the Camera Row

The Camera Row displays all angles for your game:

### Primary Camera

- Marked with a **PRIMARY** badge
- Always Camera 1 in the order
- Used as the reference for syncing other cameras
- Play tags are tied to the primary camera's timeline

### Secondary Cameras

- Appear after the primary camera
- Show sync offset status
- Can be reordered if needed

### Camera Information

Each camera thumbnail shows:

- Camera label (customizable)
- Duration
- Sync offset (if not the primary)
- Processing status

---

## Syncing Cameras

Syncing ensures all camera angles show the same moment simultaneously. This is essential for switching between angles during playback.

### Why Sync?

Cameras often start recording at different times. Without syncing:

- Switching angles jumps to a different moment
- Comparing plays across angles is difficult
- Tagging becomes inconsistent

### The Sync Process

Youth Coach Hub uses a two-step sync process:

#### Step 1: Mark the Primary Camera

1. Click **Sync Cameras** in the Camera Row
2. The Sync Modal opens with your primary camera
3. Play the video to find a recognizable moment:
   - Ball snap
   - Whistle blow
   - Big hit
   - Any clear visual/audio cue
4. Use the playback controls to find the exact frame
5. Click **Mark This Moment**

#### Step 2: Match on Secondary Cameras

1. For each secondary camera, click **Sync**
2. Find the **same moment** you marked on the primary
3. Use playback controls to match it precisely
4. Click **Mark & Save Sync**
5. Repeat for each secondary camera

### Playback Controls in Sync

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Play/Pause | Toggle playback |
| -5s / +5s | Jump 5 seconds |
| -1s / +1s | Fine-tune by 1 second |

### Sync Offset Explained

After syncing, each camera shows an offset:

- **+3s** means this camera started 3 seconds *after* the primary
- **-5s** means this camera started 5 seconds *before* the primary
- **Synced** (0s) means cameras started at the same time

### Re-syncing a Camera

If sync seems off:

1. Click **Sync Cameras**
2. Find the camera
3. Click **Re-sync**
4. Repeat the matching process

## Switching Camera Angles

### During Playback

1. Click on any camera thumbnail to switch
2. Playback automatically adjusts for sync offset
3. The selected camera shows a blue highlight

### While Tagging

- Switch cameras to see different angles of the same play
- Tags are saved to the primary camera's timeline
- Sync ensures you're viewing the correct moment

---

## Camera Labels

Give meaningful names to your cameras:

### Editing Camera Labels

1. In the Camera Row, each camera shows a default label
2. Click the label to edit (if available)
3. Enter a descriptive name

### Suggested Labels

- "Sideline - Wide"
- "End Zone - North"
- "End Zone - South"
- "Press Box"
- "Tight - Offense"
- "Tight - Defense"

---

## Video Groups (Combining Clips)

If you have multiple video clips from the same camera (e.g., one file per quarter), you can combine them into a group.

### Creating a Video Group

1. Upload all clip files for the camera
2. Click **Combine Videos**
3. Name the group (e.g., "Sideline - Full Game")
4. Select videos in playback order
5. Reorder if needed
6. Click **Create Group**

### How Groups Work

- Group plays as one continuous video
- Seamless transition between clips
- Single timeline for tagging

## Best Practices

### Recording Tips

**For Sideline Camera:**
- Position at the 50-yard line if possible
- Elevate the camera (ladder, bleachers)
- Follow the ball, not individual players

**For End Zone Camera:**
- Center behind the goal post
- Elevate for better angle on line play
- Keep a wide shot to see all players

### Sync Tips

**Choose a clear sync point:**
- Ball snap is ideal (visual and audio)
- Whistle is good if visible
- Big collisions work well
- Avoid moments with lots of similar motion

**Verify your sync:**
- After syncing, switch cameras during a play
- The action should match seamlessly
- Re-sync if there's a noticeable jump

### Organization Tips

- Upload cameras in a consistent order
- Label cameras immediately after upload
- Sync all cameras before starting to tag
- Use the same camera positions game-to-game

---

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Processing

- Check your internet connection
- Verify the file format is supported (MP4, MOV, etc.)
- Try uploading again
- Large files may take longer

### Sync Seems Wrong

- Re-sync using a different reference moment
- Try a moment with clear visual action
- Verify you're marking the exact same moment
- Check that videos aren't corrupted

### Can't Add More Cameras

- Check your plan's camera limit
- Upgrade for more camera slots
- Consider combining multiple clips into groups

### Playback Jumping

- Cameras may not be synced correctly
- Re-sync all secondary cameras
- Verify the primary camera is set correctly

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When in the Sync Modal:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Play/Pause |
| `Left Arrow` | Rewind 1 second |
| `Right Arrow` | Forward 1 second |

## Overview

Youth Coach Hub enforces storage limits to ensure fair usage and reliable performance. These limits apply at three levels: your total team storage, per-game storage, and per-camera duration.

## Storage Limits by Plan

### Team Total Storage

Your plan determines how much total film storage your team can use across all games:

| Plan | Total Storage |
|------|---------------|
| Basic | 10 GB |
| Plus | 50 GB |
| Premium | 200 GB |

This is the combined size of all video files uploaded to your team, across all games.

### Per-Game Limits

Each individual game has a storage limit to prevent any single game from consuming too much of your total quota:

| Plan | Max Storage Per Game | Max Duration Per Game |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Basic | 5 GB | 3 hours |
| Plus | 15 GB | 9 hours |
| Premium | 25 GB | 15 hours |

### Per-Camera Limits

When using multiple cameras, each camera angle is limited to **3 hours** of video regardless of your plan. This applies whether you upload a single long video or combine multiple clips.

| Plan | Cameras Per Game | Per-Camera Duration |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Basic | 1 | 3 hours |
| Plus | 3 | 3 hours each |
| Premium | 5 | 3 hours each |

## How Storage Is Calculated

### File Size

Storage is measured by the actual file size of your uploaded videos. A typical game video might be:

- **Low quality (720p, 5 Mbps):** ~2 GB per hour
- **Standard quality (1080p, 10 Mbps):** ~4.5 GB per hour
- **High quality (1080p, 15 Mbps):** ~6.5 GB per hour

### Duration

Video duration is detected automatically when you upload. If you use the timeline editor to combine multiple clips on a camera, the total duration of all clips counts toward your per-camera limit.

## Checking Your Storage Usage

### Team Storage on the Film Page

When viewing any game's film, you'll see a **storage indicator** in the status bar at the top of the page (next to the score and plays tagged count). This compact indicator shows:

- Total storage used vs. your quota (e.g., "2.5 GB / 10 GB")
- Percentage of quota used
- Color-coded progress bar:
  - **Green:** Normal usage
  - **Amber:** 80%+ usage (running low)
  - **Red:** Quota exceeded

The storage indicator updates automatically after uploads and deletions.

### Warning Messages

When your storage is running low (80%+ used), the indicator turns amber as a warning. If you exceed your quota, the indicator turns red and displays a message explaining that you need to delete videos or upgrade your plan to continue uploading.

## What Happens When You Hit a Limit

### Team Storage Full

If your team's total storage is full:

- New uploads will be blocked
- You'll see a message explaining the limit
- Options: Delete old games, upgrade your plan, or wait for games to expire

### Game Storage Full

If a game reaches its storage limit:

- Additional uploads to that game are blocked
- You can still upload to other games
- Consider compressing videos or removing unused footage

### Camera Duration Exceeded

If a camera reaches its 3-hour limit:

- Additional clips cannot be added to that camera lane
- You can add clips to other cameras (if you haven't reached the per-game camera limit)
- Remove or trim existing clips to free up duration

## Managing Your Storage

### Tips for Efficient Storage Use

**Compress Before Upload:**
- Use HandBrake (free) or your video editing software
- Target 10-12 Mbps bitrate for good quality at reasonable file size
- 1080p resolution is sufficient for film review

**Remove Unused Footage:**
- Delete pre-game warmups and post-game footage
- Trim halftime from your videos before uploading
- Focus on game action only

**Use Game Expiration:**
- Games automatically expire based on your plan's retention period
- Basic: 30 days, Plus: 180 days, Premium: 365 days
- Expired games free up storage automatically

### Deleting Videos

To free up storage:

1. Go to the game's film page
2. Find the video you want to remove
3. Click the delete option
4. Confirm deletion

> **Warning:** Deleted videos cannot be recovered. Any play tags linked to the video will also be removed.

## Upgrading for More Storage

The only way to get more storage or longer retention is to upgrade your subscription:

| Upgrade | Storage Increase | Per-Game Storage | Additional Benefits |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Basic to Plus | 10 GB → 50 GB | 5 GB → 15 GB | 3 cameras, 180-day retention |
| Plus to Premium | 50 GB → 200 GB | 15 GB → 25 GB | 5 cameras, 365-day retention |

There are no add-on options for extra storage or extended retention.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is there a per-game limit?

Per-game limits ensure that no single game monopolizes your storage quota. This helps you maintain film for multiple games throughout the season rather than running out of space after a few uploads.

### Does the per-camera limit apply to combined clips?

Yes. If you use the timeline editor to combine multiple video clips on one camera lane, the total duration of all clips counts toward the 3-hour per-camera limit.

### What counts toward my storage?

Only successfully uploaded video files count toward your storage. Failed or cancelled uploads don't consume storage.

### Do play tags use storage?

No. Play tags are metadata and don't count toward your storage quota. You can tag as many plays as you want without affecting storage.

### What happens to my storage if I downgrade?

If you downgrade to a plan with less storage:

- Your existing files remain but may exceed your new quota
- You won't be able to upload new videos until you're under the limit
- Consider deleting old games before downgrading

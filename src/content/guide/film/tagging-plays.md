1. Navigate to your team's **Film** section
2. Select a game
3. Click on a video to open the film viewer

### Basic Tagging Workflow

1. **Play the video** until you reach the start of a play
2. Click **Mark Start** to set the play's beginning
3. Let the play run, then click **Mark End**
4. Fill in the play details in the tagging form
5. Click **Save Play** to record the tag

## Understanding Tagging Tiers

Youth Coach Hub offers different levels of detail based on your needs:

### Tier 1: Little League

Simplified tagging focused on participation:

- Quarter and time
- Ball carrier
- Yards gained
- Result (touchdown, first down, etc.)

### Tier 2: Basic

Standard tagging for game planning:

- All Tier 1 fields
- Down and distance
- Formation and play type
- QB and target (for passes)
- Drive tracking

### Tier 3: Advanced

Comprehensive data for detailed analysis:

- All Tier 2 fields
- Offensive line performance
- Defensive player tracking
- Situational tags (motion, blitz, etc.)
- Coverage information

## Play Details

### Context Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Down | 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th down |
| Distance | Yards needed for first down |
| Yard Line | Field position (1-99) |
| Hash | Left, middle, or right hash |

### Result Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Yards Gained | Net yards on the play |
| Result | Outcome (complete, incomplete, run, etc.) |
| First Down | Did the play result in a first down? |
| Turnover | Was there a fumble or interception? |

## Auto-Population

Youth Coach Hub automatically calculates the next play's context based on the previous play:

- **Down** advances automatically
- **Distance** adjusts based on yards gained and penalties
- **Yard Line** updates based on the result

Auto-populated fields are highlighted in blue. You can always override these values manually.

> **Tip:** If a penalty was declined, check the "Penalty Declined" box so it doesn't affect the next play's calculations.

## Tagging Tips

### Be Consistent

Use the same criteria for success/failure across all plays. This ensures your analytics are meaningful.

### Tag Both Teams

Tag both your offensive plays and opponent's plays. This gives you:

- Defensive analytics for your team
- Scouting data on opponents

### Use Drives

Group plays into drives to see:

- Points per drive
- Drive efficiency
- Red zone performance

### Review Your Tags

Periodically review tagged plays to ensure accuracy. Incorrect tags lead to incorrect analytics.
